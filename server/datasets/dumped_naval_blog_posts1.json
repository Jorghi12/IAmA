[{"title": "Matt Ridley: How Innovation Works, Part 2", "text": "Naval interviews Matt Ridley, the author of The Red Queen and, recently, How Innovation Works. Also see Part 1.\nInnovation Famine\nMatt: I have a chapter towards the end of the book where I complain about the fact that we are living through an innovation famine, not an innovation feast\u2014particularly in areas other than digital. One of the reasons for this is the power of the environmental movement to oppose new technologies, which are often good for the environment. I detail the case of genetically modified organisms, where you make a plant insect-resistant and have the capacity to wean agriculture of chemical pesticides. This has been proven to work and is now being used in India, Brazil and North America as well\u2014but not in Europe and Africa where an entire technology has effectively been rejected by the pressure of environmentalists.\nMy good friend Mark Lynas was one of the most prominent campaigners against this technology in the 1990s and did a lot of the protesting a lot of the writing about it. And then he changed his mind and said, \u201cWe were doing the wrong thing, but it\u2019s almost too late.\u201d It\u2019s very hard to see how Europe now changes its minds and adopts this new technology. The best hope is that with the next technology that comes along, which is genome editing through things like CRISPR, a lot of the concerns of environmentalists can be set to one side because this is not a technology that involves bringing foreign genetic material from other creatures, whatever that means, into plants. So it\u2019s possible that we can leapfrog into some cleaner technologies there.\nThe end point must be that the more we innovate, the fewer resources we need, the less land we need, the more land we can give back to nature, the more we can make people prosperous, and that results in them cutting their birth rate. It also results in them planting more trees. There is a possible soft landing for humanity later in this century, if we do plenty more innovation. We could end up with 8 or 9 billion people living lives that are much more benign towards the natural environment and that enable most of us to have greenery around us.\nThe COVID pandemic has shown us, quite starkly, that we have not been doing enough innovation. We\u2019ve not been developing enough vaccines; we\u2019ve not been finding ways of developing vaccines faster; we\u2019ve not been developing enough diagnostic devices. When you look at why not, you find that there is 17 to 20 months of delay to get a license to sell a new diagnostic device. This is enough to deter most entrepreneurs from even trying to go into that area. I hope one message people take is that, if we can do more innovation, we will not destroy the planet. It\u2019s quite the reverse. It\u2019s the safest way of saving the planet. The poorest countries are the ones seeing the most damage to the environment at the moment.\nNaval: One of the things that David Deutsch does in his works that he often talks about is how anything that is possible or not forbidden by the laws of physics is possible for us to create through technology and science. As universal explainers, humans are capable of understanding anything that any being or any theoretical creatures capable of understanding. All we have to do is figure out how to reconfigure the existing atoms and particles out there to do what we want within the laws of physics, which are quite generous and quite broad. In that sense, all failures and all sins are just ignorance. It\u2019s just the lack of knowledge.\n\u201cWe are capable of making objects, even our simplest objects that are beyond the capability of one human mind to comprehend.\u201d\nIf we were to speed up the accumulation and application of knowledge through innovation, we would be able to solve all of humanity\u2019s problems. And we\u2019re always at the beginning of this infinity, as he says, because there\u2019s an infinite amount of progress to be made. There\u2019s so far to go that when you look at where we are at any given point on that curve, infinity stretches out in front of you. I find that extremely hopeful. But as you point out, we can be our own worst enemies in these cases.\nMatt: It\u2019s a very important part of rational optimism that we are not saying the world is perfect. Quite the reverse. That\u2019s what the word optimism meant when it was coined by Voltaire: You thought the world was perfect and couldn\u2019t be improved anymore. That\u2019s not what people like me and David Deutsch are saying. We\u2019re saying there is an incredible amount of improvement that we haven\u2019t even yet begun to imagine. We are at the start of a very long run on Broadway, as a species. We\u2019re not towards the end. We are going to see some amazing novelties in the current century. One of my beefs with the environmental movement\u2014as you say, not the conservation movement that deals with local greenery but the planetary one\u2014is that it imagines that we\u2019re not going to be able to invent very much and, if we do invent things, they will do harm. That doesn\u2019t feel right to me. We\u2019ve hardly scraped the surface of different ways of combining and recombining the atoms and elements of the world. Paul Romer talked about how many different compounds of the minerals in the periodic table could be made. It\u2019s an astronomical number, and we\u2019ve hardly explored the properties of half of them. Like you, I\u2019m a fan of fusion energy and I think that could make a huge difference within our lifetimes. There\u2019s all sorts of things that we\u2019re going to be able to do in this century to improve humanity but also to make it a livable place.\nNaval: There\u2019s this spaceship-earth metaphor that a lot of people latch onto instinctively because it\u2019s seductive. People say the earth is this fragile, precious blue marble that gives us everything we want, and that when we destroy our home, there\u2019s no place else left. We can\u2019t get off Spaceship Earth. This treats earth as a zero-sum game. But upon closer examination, it falls apart. Even earth is hostile to the idea of 7 billion humans living on it. The only way 7 billion humans live on earth is through innovation through technology and through modifying the environment. The challenge is how to do it in a sustainable way\u2014and then figure out how to do it on other planets, and Terraform Mars and the moon to make them livable. It requires a careful reexamination of this spaceship-earth metaphor, which most people instinctively believe, but upon examination turns out to be incorrect.\nMatt: You mentioned knowledge as being potentially infinite. It\u2019s very important to emphasize that knowledge is a distributed and collective phenomenon. I go back to this wonderful little essay that was written by Leonard Reed in the 1950s called \u201cI Pencil\u201d in which a pencil works out how it came into existence and discovers that millions of people contributed to its manufacturer\u2014from people cutting down trees for the wood to people mining graphite for the lead. The important point is that not one of them knows how to make a pencil.\nWe are capable of making objects, even our simplest objects that are beyond the capability of one human mind to comprehend. It requires lots of human minds to collaborate, to make them and to accumulate the knowledge of how to invent them as well. At this point I begin to sound a bit like a Marxist because I start talking about collective humanity, but it\u2019s a way of rescuing collaboration, cooperation and partnership from a communist perspective and restoring it to a much more voluntary end of the political spectrum, if you like.\nNaval: Cooperation is the basis for the species. For example, ants and bees look like hive creatures, but they don\u2019t cooperate across genetic boundaries. We\u2019re the only creatures that cooperate across genetic boundaries and do long-range planning with each other. Yuval Noah Harari, he talks about this.\nMatt: We know how to cooperate with strangers, and they don\u2019t.\nNaval: If you and I were to belong to any other species\u2014whether dogs or mice or ants\u2014given how genetically different you and I are and how culturally different you and I are, if we encountered each other in real life we\u2019d probably attack each other or fight over the same habitat. We couldn\u2019t cooperate or converse. That is a unique feature that we should be proud of. You need cooperation, and no one person understands any of these complex systems. It\u2019s why I laugh when macro economists build their models trying to figure out where the economy is going to go. The economy is far too big for any one individual to understand. It\u2019s an emergent, complex system of billions of actors. So these models, by definition, cherry-pick a few shaky assumptions and end up miraculously converging and whatever political bias the macro economists happened to have in the first place.\nCOVID-19\nMatt: That\u2019s one of the problems we\u2019re seeing at the moment with the modeling of the pandemic. It\u2019s an attempt to understand a bottom-up phenomenon with a top-down approach. The other way of putting it is to say roughly 10 million people eat lunch in London on a normal day, but most of them choose what to eat at the last minute. How is it possible that the right amounts of the right kinds of food are available, in the right places, at the right time for that to happen? Who is London\u2019s lunch commissioner? He or she must be unbelievably intelligent. And, of course, there is no such person. And if there was, it would be an absolute disaster.\nNaval: Then we would all be eating Soviet-style glop rations, and half of us would be starving. There\u2019d be long lines. Unfortunately in 2020, the economists are building epidemic models and the epidemiologists are running the economy, so we\u2019ve got it backwards. We\u2019re trapped in a bad situation in which we are not willing to put a value on a single human life. You\u2019ve put these health officers in charge who didn\u2019t train or sign up to run the entire world\u2014and they\u2019re terrified they\u2019ll be blamed for excess deaths if they let up too early. It\u2019s very hard to calculate the economic consequences, so they\u2019re going to keep us locked down for quite a while. I\u2019m intrigued by the Swedish model, not because it\u2019s necessarily the best one. (The best one would have been if we had isolated and crushed the curve like Hong Kong and Taiwan did.) But given that most of the Western countries are large democracies and don\u2019t have the ability or the willpower to do that, we\u2019re all headed towards a Swedish model one way or another, whatever that turns out to be.\nMatt: Thank goodness for Sweden not locking down because, otherwise, the Western world would have been able to say, \u201cWell, there is no alternative.\u201d We know there is an alternative. Though Sweden had a huge amount of voluntary social distancing, the country didn\u2019t have compulsory lockdowns and hasn\u2019t damage its economy nearly as badly as countries like Britain and the U.S. Sweden has shown that the most important measures in getting on top of this pandemic are almost certainly the voluntary ones\u2014things like not shaking hands, not having large gatherings, staying a safe distance from each other\u2014not confining everyone to their homes.\nNaval: It makes no sense that big box retailers are open, but small businesses are not allowed to open. Obviously, the best response is a bottoms-up distributed response. You can beat the virus when individuals all panic, not when the governments panic. But a single panicked individual can outsmart the virus. Governments don\u2019t know how to control viruses, but they do know how to control individuals; whereas an individual can control their own health, safety and viral spread. So we\u2019ve taken an education problem and turned it into a government top-down control problem.\nMatt: The British government is discovering at the moment that it\u2019s quite easy to scare people and not so easy to unscare them. The draconian introduction of the lockdown was very effective. It turned out that people were willing to go along with it and even report on their neighbors. They became surprisingly authoritarian in a surprisingly short time because they were being given a very scary story. People are easily frightened about things. but when you come along and say, \u201cRight, scare over, please come back to work,\u201d half the country is saying, \u201cNo, I thought you said it was scary. We\u2019re not going out yet. And by the way, you\u2019re paying us to stay at home, so why should I?\u201d\nNaval: That\u2019s going to change. The cynical view is that, up to this point, blue collar people are the ones losing their jobs. So far it hasn\u2019t been the white collar people who run society and control the media, government, universities, think tanks and modelers. But when the white collar people start losing their jobs, people say, \u201cWait a minute. We need to take the economy into account.\u201d\n\u201cUnfortunately in 2020, the economists are building epidemic models and the epidemiologists are running the economy.\u201d\nAs the Swedish experiment is going to show, there\u2019s three different variables you simultaneously track in your head. It\u2019s very hard for most people to do that. One is, of course, the infection fatality rate and how many people end up sick or dying. The second is the economic impact\u2014you have to have some standard way of measuring and comparing that. And the third is what percentage of the population has built up a herd immunity, while keeping in mind that herd immunity through a natural spread is very different from herd immunity through a vaccine. A vaccine is indiscriminately applied; whereas when a virus naturally spreads, it\u2019 infects the more mobile super-spreaders as well as the most vulnerable first. So the people who get taken out first were either the ones who are most likely to spread it or the most likely to die. So natural herd immunity is the lower threshold than vaccine immediate herd immunity.\nMatt: It\u2019s become clear in the U.K., and I think this is largely true in the U.S., that a huge proportion of the deaths are attributable to acquired infections at hospitals and care homes. With insufficient early testing, healthcare workers became infected quite early\u2014which means they became carriers quite early\u2014because sick people were visiting healthcare facilities. As a result, a very vulnerable population\u2014 which not only had a high death rate but also a high transmission rate because they were carrying a higher loads of the virus\u2014has seen a very high reproductive rate of the virus. That doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s high in the rest of the community. The examples of Sweden and others show that, for those who are not in that category, it should be possible to use voluntary measures to suppress this virus and get to herd immunity at quite low levels of infection.\nNaval: We\u2019re going to end up in that scenario regardless, so the question will be: How much benefit did people get who tried to flatten the curve for longer periods of time? We\u2019re seeing this experiment at a state-by-state level in the U.S. right now. Of course, the battle is turning into the narrative and the interpretation of the data that\u2019s coming out saying, \u201cOh, well they\u2019re hiding deaths,\u201d \u201cThey\u2019re exaggerating this,\u201d or \u201cThey\u2019re not exaggerating that.\u201d When this is all said and done, I don\u2019t know if we will have the honesty to look back and say, \u201cWell, this is what happened,\u201d because now in an age of social media, everyone\u2019s trapped in their filter bubble/silo. Journalists serve all taken sides. Their objective journalism, to the extent that it existed, has gone out the window. So we may end up living in two different narrative worlds even once we know what happened.\nFilter Bubbles\nMatt: It does alarm me the degree to which we have, fragmented into these filter bubbles and echo chambers. In the book, I speculate that that is a consequence of technological determinism. Whereas I thought the invention of the Internet would lead to social media, would lead to us all seeing each other\u2019s points of view, it hasn\u2019t turned out that way. Social media has proved to be a very divisive medium,as radio did in the early years of the 20th century when it was a significant tool helping the rise of dictators. But television did not\u2014it was a medium that pulled us all into the mushy middle.\nNaval: I absolutely agree. When I read that section of the book, I put it down. By the way, the thing I love about your book is, every third page I had to put it down and think about it, which to me is the mark of a good book. I think the faster you can read a book, the worse the book is. If you can speed-read a book, you shouldn\u2019t. Just put that book away, it doesn\u2019t deserve to be a book. But when you cover that section, very briefly I realized: There\u2019s a big idea in here; there\u2019s a book in here. A lesser person would take these two paragraphs and turn it into a book. But you covered it very briefly.\nMy thinking on it was that the reason is because television had very high production values and very high distribution costs. You could only afford to get the message out once or twice. Especially in the old days of television, you didn\u2019t have that many channels. Therefore, people were getting their news sanitized from the same set of sources. The bad part is you could be living in a bubble controlled by the elites, by the government, or by whatever the media wants you to think. But the good news is that at least you were relatively aligned and there wasn\u2019t this constant low-level civil war going on inside society. When you get to something like radio or to the extreme social media, anybody can contribute and create content all the time. Because of that, the divisiveness is almost a given.\nIn fact, with radio there was filtering by tuning the channel. But in social media, you\u2019ve built your own channel. The level of a filter bubble that you can go into is much deeper and much more tuned to the individual than any previous filter bubble.\nMatt: There\u2019s an echo here of what happened with the invention of printing. The most entrepreneurial printer of the lot and the best published author in Europe was Martin Luther. And he is using this new technology effectively to cause a social revolution, and eventually it turns into a series of religious wars. We have been here before and it wasn\u2019t a pretty sight, if you like.\nNaval: It wasn\u2019t. And it\u2019s amazing how much the distribution of media and information changes the structure of society. You cite Amara\u2019s Law, which talks about how the effects of innovation are overestimated in the short term and underestimated the long term. I have absolutely seen that. I\u2019ve seen that in Silicon Valley over and over, everything from autonomous vehicles to the internet, to mobile phones, to crypto.\nMore Crypto\nMatt: Crypto is a good example, and I don\u2019t write enough about crypto. I wish I had done more. But I do think crypto is a good example of a technology that will continue to disappoint us for a number of years yet. Although you made some very interesting remarks about its potential, I suspect that a lot of people will lose their shirt on crypto plans for quite a while before it starts to deliver that promise\u2014if government ever allows it to, of course,\nNaval: This is where crypto is going to work a little differently than people might expect. Amara\u2019s Law generally tends to be that we overestimate 10 years, we underestimate 20 years. So 15 years is the crossover. But, obviously, as we know, history doesn\u2019t quite repeat. It can rhyme, but you never get the same result twice because, if you did, there\u2019d be no new information. It wouldn\u2019t be a complex system if you could easily predict the next step.\nSo, first of all, crypto has been around since 2009. That was the original creation of Bitcoin, so it\u2019s been longer than people think. Also, you mentioned at the end of your last statement: if states allow it. That is the whole point of crypto. Crypto solves the coordination problem that normally you could only have solved with a state, but you solve it without the state. Originally it\u2019s a solution to the Byzantine generals problem. It\u2019s not clear to me that states can stop it, because if they can, they will. No state wants an extra-judiciary system in existence, because the control of the money printing press is the ultimate power. That said, in the last two years since the hype bubble popped, there have been great entrepreneurs hard at work, and I can now see the first green shoots coming out of crypto.\nI would put them into two categories. One is we\u2019re building a decentralized finance infrastructure for borrowing, lending, derivatives, trading, custody, all of that stuff. The things that Wall Street does for 20% of the GDP of the United States will be done for 1% of the GDP in cryptoland. It\u2019s getting so good that I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if, a few years from now, you see more Wall Street traders saying, \u201cI want to make a certain bet.\u201d \u201cI have a certain point of view.\u201d \u201cI want to hedge in a certain way.\u201d Or, \u201cI want to buy a certain asset, but I can\u2019t do it with the existing financial infrastructure. I have to convert into Bitcoin or Ethereum and go do that through decentralized finance.\u201d It\u2019s just technologically far superior, that\u2019s one thing I\u2019m seeing.\nThe other thing I\u2019m seeing is, the first applications of crypto come out in file storage and authentication and identity. These are plumbing infrastructure for Internet companies being built in the crypto domain. And the crypto versions are superior to the non-crypto versions because they\u2019re decentralized. They\u2019re no longer under the control of Apple, Google or Facebook.\nIndependent developers do not like to live under the control of Apple, Google, Facebook, Twitter or whoever, because they know they can be de-platformed at any time. They know that platform operator will capture the majority of the value. They know if they strike oil, the platform operator will come in and take it over.\nWe\u2019re going to see crypto-based plumbing laid out, and we\u2019re going to see decentralized finance lay that out over the next five years. That is where the green shoots of crypto are coming up. And then, in the following decade, we\u2019re going see the results of that and they\u2019re gonna be bigger than we can anticipate\nMatt: That\u2019s very hopeful, as you say, because it is important to be able to retain our individual autonomy in this world. And I do, at the moment, feel as if the government on the one hand and Facebook on the other, is finding ways of constricting my freedom of expression, thought and argument and, indeed, the facts I have access to.\nNaval: The government gets to restrict you because it has a monopoly on violence. People try to hijack the government, because if you can get the government to do your bidding, you\u2019ve got guys with guns to do your bidding and you run everything. What cryptography enables is, it\u2019s the first asymmetric advantage for the defender against the attacker, probably since the castle wall or the moat.\nIn the history of warfare, the attacker has been gaining huge advantages and the defender has been losing them since the canon and the gun were invented. That favors the attacker. Nuclear weapons obviously favor the attacker. Biological weapons favor the attacker. Airstrikes favor the attacker. Tanks favor the attacker.\nMatt: The machine gun favored the defender, funny enough. That\u2019s what made trench warfare so static.\nNaval: That\u2019s a good point. Yes, I missed that one. So crypto the attacker can throw unlimited compute power at it, but if you\u2019ve done your security correctly, they can\u2019t break your encryption key, so it favors the defender. And of course, whichever way the power goes, that\u2019s the way the control, identity and anonymity goes. We\u2019re losing physical anonymity with camera surveillance, the NSA spying on everybody and Internet-connected cameras everywhere. Physical privacy is dead.\nThe government will always know where you are physically, unless you\u2019re going to do a face change all the time. People talk about the comeback of masks covering it. No, that won\u2019t cover it\u2014just a slightly better algorithm is required. If another human can recognize you, eventually the computer will recognize you, because that\u2019s one of the very easy problems for AI and machine learning.\nThat said, digital privacy is real. You will be able to create a personal cryptographically protected identity that goes on the Internet, and you can build a reputation against it, you can do business against it, you can make friends against it, and no one will quite know who you are. Sure, the NSA and people sniffing the fiber lines could potentially unmask you, but if you are sophisticated enough, there are even ways to get past that.\nAutomation\nThat leads us to how governments approach our freedoms. They have a lot of power over us, and so people like to create narratives to take that power over. One of the narratives that comes up every 20 years is automation and job loss.\nThis time it\u2019s AGI, artificial general intelligence, that we\u2019re going to come up with a technology that advances so quickly that it improves itself faster than we can retrain, faster than we can create new jobs, and we all get put out of jobs. There\u2019s two pieces to this. There is the pace of innovation of AI and what AI means. The second piece is that, this time, it\u2019s different: We\u2019re going to lose our jobs. And I thought you had very good viewpoints on that.\nMatt: We\u2019ve been here before. We\u2019ve expected innovation and automation to destroy jobs. It never does. It always creates new kinds of opportunities for employment. It creates the wealth that enables people to employ other people.\nIt also does create leisure. It does reduce the amount of time we have to work in our life. We can spend more time in education and retirement. We can have longer weekends than our grandparents did. To some extent, for the first time the upper-middle class bourgeois professions are feeling under threat from automation. While factory workers and farm hands were being automated, they didn\u2019t mind. But now doctors and lawyers can be displaced by machines, and suddenly we must all panic. Every time it\u2019s been raised as an urgent issue in the past 50 years, it\u2019s proved to be wrong. I think it will be this time, too. Of course, there will be local disruptions caused to employment by different forms of automation and innovation. One can\u2019t deny that.\nNaval: And, in fact, many of these disruptions could not have existed if a previous generation of automation had been allowed to take place. For example, you can\u2019t lose your job as a truck driver if trucks didn\u2019t exist. If you had stopped trucks in the first place, because you were trying to protect people in the railway industry or people who were carrying things on their backs.\nA lot of the economy today is based on luxury goods. As you mentioned in the book, until I can get all the peeled grapes and massages that I want on demand, there\u2019s still room for more employment. And we shift what we consider jobs to be. There are things that we just haven\u2019t figured out how to do yet with automation and robotics.\nMatt: If you could reach this theoretical end point where a machine does everything you could possibly need, then you don\u2019t have a problem.\nNaval: Why would you? Work is not good in and of itself. You should just be able to write books, record podcasts and entertain your fellow monkeys all day long. As you point out through innovation, a lot of this automation that happens is highly democratizing. It\u2019s democratic consumption. You also make a good point where it is the nature of modern civilization to consolidate production through specialization. So the one person in the world who\u2019s best at anything gets to do that for everybody. But on the flip side, you democratize consumption, where not everybody can have access to everything.\nMatt: What we tend to do as a species, as we progress, is to become more and more specialized in what we produce but more and more diversified in what we consume. That saying I got from a wonderful book called Second Nature, years ago by a man named Haim Ofek. I wrote to him and said, \u201cThis is an interesting insight. Have you written anything more about it?\u201d He replied, \u201cWell, I think I got that idea from one of your books.\u201d\nNaval: It\u2019s funny because I have a tweet about that exact topic that goes back a few years, and I have no idea where I got that from. It might\u2019ve been from one of your books. It might\u2019ve been from David Deutsch. It might\u2019ve been some random thing, I don\u2019t even know.\nMatt: You have said things to me today about things you\u2019ve got from my books that are fresh to me, as if you\u2019ve made this point, as it were, we each put ideas into the public realm, we pick them up, we changed them slightly, we give them back to each other\u2014that\u2019s the nature of intelligent conversation.\nGreat Man Theory\nNaval: This ties back into the great man or great woman theory of history. After reading your book, I had to think about that a little bit because I had subconsciously subscribed 70-80% to the great man theory of history and 20-30% to the evolutionary theory of history. And in hindsight, that was probably a flawed balance.\nOne reconciliation that I came up with is that it does take great people to move the world forward, but it doesn\u2019t necessarily take that specific great person. Although we needed Edison to create the light bulb, there were 21 other people creating the light bulb at around the same time. We needed one of those 21 people to be the innovator to drive it forward.\nSo it\u2019s not that there\u2019s one individual at any given time who can do anything, but there is a set of special individuals and any one of them in the right situation will suffice\u2014or any set of them will suffice. That\u2019s the conclusion that I came to.\nMatt: Whereas Leonardo DaVinci did not have to worry about somebody else painting the Mona Lisa before he did, there\u2019s something particularly challenging, brilliant and clever about being the first person to develop a practical light bulb.\nIf you\u2019re in a race, it\u2019s even more impressive that you do it. To some extent, the fact that it\u2019s not a unique achievement is even more impressive.\nNaval: I had a mild case of Gell-Mann Amnesia within your book, if you remember that framework. Gell-Mann Amnesia says that, you believe everything you read in the newspapers, then when it gets to a topic that you\u2019re intimately familiar with, you realize it\u2019s nonsense. Or it doesn\u2019t quite apply, yet you continue believing everything else that they write about.\nI\u2019m not blaming you. You did a great job. But there was a dissonance where you proved your point by showing that we tend to over lionize and remember a few inventors as being the creators when it\u2019s much more of a team and distributed process. You were giving examples of inventors and people who get credit throughout history. Then later in the book, you talk about Facebook as an innovator, Airbnb as an innovator, and you mentioned the founders, Brian Chesky and Mark Zuckerberg.\nBut anyone who\u2019s been in Silicon Valley for a while knows that before there was Facebook, there was Myspace and before there was Myspace, there was Friendster. Poor Jonathan Abrams, who created Friendster, is left as the beaver looking at the dam and saying, \u201cWhose dam?\u201d It\u2019s the same with Airbnb: There was VRBO, HomeAway and a bunch of vacation rental sites before that, although Airbnb did pioneer the individual room breakup.\nBut there was Couchsurfing, there was Craigslist and a whole bunch of others. Unfortunately, history is written by the victors. And in this case, the victors don\u2019t even have to write history; it\u2019s everyone around them who\u2019s writing history. There\u2019s availability bias: They see the victor, so to the victor go the spoils and the credit.\nMatt: That\u2019s absolutely right, and I stand corrected on both of those. You couldn\u2019t be more right.\nThe Book\nNaval: Matt, you have this new book out, How Innovation Works. It\u2019s a must-read for entrepreneurs and government officials who want to either be innovative themselves or foster innovation in their geography or society. Frankly, if you were an entrepreneur, self-styled inventor or innovator, this is probably the cheapest, fastest education you can get on the history and future of innovation. I highly recommend it. I\u2019m going to leave with a quote that I like from the book that summarizes what innovation is and where it\u2019s fostered. It has a very optimistic and correct view of how it operates. That quote is: \u201cInnovation is the child of freedom because it is a free and creative attempt to satisfy freely expressed human desires.\u201d That\u2019s a powerful quote for me. It tells me that innovation requires freedom. It\u2019s creative, and we\u2019re satisfying what people want to do, as opposed to what they\u2019re told or forced to do.\nSo thank you, Matt, for helping me figure out evolution. I highly recommend Genome as well, to figure out the rational basis behind ethics and the origin of virtue. You helped make me an optimist in a rational way through your famous Rational Optimist, and you drive home the point of the evolution of innovation and how to foster it in How Innovation Works. It\u2019s been a pleasure.\nMatt: Naval, thank you for the incredible insights that you\u2019ve given me today, for your fantastic, kind remarks and for the fact that you said this book should be read by people who do innovation, because I\u2019m a bit of a fraud. I\u2019m not an innovator; I\u2019ve not invented anything; I\u2019ve not built a business; I\u2019m not an entrepreneur. I\u2019m a writer. So I\u2019m greatly honored that you think the book is a practical use to people, as well as being an interesting tour of the ideas behind this mysterious concept of human innovation.", "sentiment": 0.224, "pageUrl": "https://nav.al/matt-ridley-2", "date": "Tue, 14 Jul 2020 23:00:00 GMT", "person": "naval_ravikant"}, {"title": "Matt Ridley: How Innovation Works, Part 1", "text": "Naval interviews Matt Ridley, the author of The Red Queen and, recently, How Innovation Works.\nTranscript\nNaval: I don\u2019t have heroes, but there are people who I look up to and have learned a lot from, and Matt Ridley, who is on the line, has got to be near the top of that list. Growing up, I was a voracious reader, especially of science. Matt had a bigger influence on pulling me into science, and a love of science, than almost any other author. His first book that I read was called Genome. I must have six or seven dog-eared copies of it lying around in various boxes. It helped me define what life is, how it works, why it\u2019s important, and placed evolution as a binding principle in the center of my worldview. That\u2019s a common theme that runs across Matt\u2019s books.\nAfter that, I read his book The Red Queen, which laid out the age-old competition between bacteria, viruses and humans\u2014a topic that\u2019s extremely relevant today. I also read his book The Rational Optimist, which helped me realize that it was rational to be optimistic, because of the technological and scientific advancement that we\u2019ve had as human species since we first came across the stone ax and basic tools.\nHis book The Origins of Virtue helped me take a game-theoretical framework towards virtues and ethics. His book The Evolution of Everything continued that theme towards everything evolving. I\u2019m sad to say I\u2019ve missed one or two of your books in there, Matt. The Agile Gene, I have to go back and read that one. And most recently,\nMatt wrote a great book called How Innovation Works, which will be out by the time this podcast is out there. I had the pleasure of reading an advance copy over the last week.\nWelcome, Matt. I\u2019m honored to have you here. Do you want to give us a little bit of your background and how you got into writing about science?\nMatt\u2019s Background\nMatt: Naval, it\u2019s great to meet you and interesting to hear that story of how you\u2019ve read so many of my books and got the point of them. It\u2019s wonderful. I\u2019m someone who\u2019s enjoyed writing all my life. I became a professional journalist after a brief career as a scientist. I only got as far as doing a PhD in biology and then decided that I wanted to be a writer instead. So I became a journalist. I was a science editor at The Economist for a number of years and also served as a political reporter and correspondent there as well.\nI then became a freelance writer. That was when I wrote The Red Queen, which was a book close to the topic I\u2019d been studying as a biologist, that is to say, the evolution of sex. From there on, I\u2019ve been incredibly lucky because people have given me contracts to write books about things that interest me. At the moment it\u2019s about every five years that I do a book. But I don\u2019t do a book until I\u2019m interested enough in a topic. It\u2019s a very difficult decision, plunging into writing a book on one topic and thereby not doing all the other topics you want to write books about.\nThe New Book\nNaval: I read this book in preparation for this conversation, so it\u2019s suffered from becoming a chore. Because normally one reads purely for enjoyment at their leisure and this time it became more about hitting a deadline. That said, this has been your most impactful book for me since Genome. It was very revealing. There are two things about this book that put it in a different class than your previous books, for me.\nOne is that it corrected a long-standing misconception I had about how Silicon Valley works. I am steeped in Silicon Valley. I\u2019ve been here since 1996, I\u2019m an investor in hundreds of companies. I\u2019ve started close to a dozen companies. I thought I knew this game as well as anybody, and your book corrected a serious error that I had in my mind of the framework of how Silicon Valley works. And we can get into that.\nThe second thing about this book is that it was actionable. The first half was this collection of incredible stories about inventors and innovators that would be fun, historical reading in its own right. But then the second half explains how innovation works, what helps it works and what stops it from working, what creates the conditions for it to work and not work.\nSo I recommend this book for two classes of people. One is innovators and would-be innovators themselves. If you\u2019re an entrepreneur in Silicon Valley, Shanghai or Bangalore and you\u2019re thinking about creating products\u2014whether it\u2019s social media, launching rockets, building airplanes or genetic engineering\u2014you need to read this book because it will give you a better view of the history of innovation as well as the future of innovation than any other book that I know of. That context will be incredibly important when you\u2019re trying to figure out things like: \u201cDo I file patents? How important is the role of science? How important is the role of government? How long will it take for my innovation to be adopted? How much can I expect to sink into legal battles, vs. explaining things to people, vs. building the product?\u201d So it\u2019s a must-read for that category of people.\nThe other category that it\u2019s very relevant for is government officials. Because to the extent that many of them pay lip service to the idea of building \u201cthe next Silicon Valley\u201d or attracting entrepreneurship, they don\u2019t know how. People ask me this all the time, and I give them basic, vague things like, \u201cYeah, you need to have some freedom, you need to have nice weather, you need to have a university system.\u201d But this book has an actionable playbook near the end for how to foster that environment.\nMatt: I\u2019m very encouraged that you think it\u2019s practical and actionable because that\u2019s one thing I wanted to do in this book. Most of my books are, on the whole, thinking about the world, rather than changing the world. But in this case, I wanted to try and zero in on the practicalities of what innovation does involve.\nNaval: There\u2019s one line that I pulled out from near the end of the book which is this idea that \u201cinnovation is the child of freedom and the parent of prosperity.\u201d I love that line. That\u2019s a great tweet right there. Child of freedom, as to how do you create innovation? You have a very expansive definition of freedom in there. And the parents of prosperity, why it\u2019s important. We can get into both of those, but I thought that was a good summary. I don\u2019t know if you meant that to be the summary, but that is the one that stuck out to me.\nMatt: Yes, indeed. Your ideas are often triggered by other people\u2019s ideas. You almost need someone else to tell you what you\u2019re saying. This freedom theme, which ended up on the cover of the book, was pointed out to me by the first reader of the book, a very intelligent friend of mine, John Constable, who thinks about things very deeply.\nHe came back and he said, \u201cWell, the basic theme is freedom. Have you realized that?\u201d And I said, \u201cI don\u2019t think I have realized that, no.\u201d I then rewrote some sections, and that\u2019s probably where that soundbite came from. It was one of the last rewrites.\nNaval: Another theme that is very obvious and profound is that there\u2019s this conversation that goes on over and over about almost everything in history: Is history the product of a few great men and women, a few great accomplishments, a few great moments, a few great battles, a few great inventions that happen to come along, or is it an inevitable, inexorable and evolved process? You conclusively lay out, with lots of evidence, that innovation is an evolutionary process, rather than an invention process. And you call it innovation rather than invention. That seems a deliberate choice. Tell me about that choice.\nInvention vs. Innovation\nMatt: I try to draw a distinction between invention and innovation. It\u2019s not a distinction that is cast in iron, but I think this is the best way to think about it. Invention is the coming up with a prototype of a new device or a new social practice innovation. Innovation is the business of turning a new device into something practical, affordable and reliable that people will want to use and acquire. It\u2019s the process of driving down the price; it\u2019s the process of driving up the reliability and the efficiency of the device; and it\u2019s the process of persuading other people to adopt it, too. Thomas Edison captures this point very well. I don\u2019t think he used the word \u201cinnovation\u201d much\u2014he used the word \u201cinvention\u201d\u2014but he is mainly an innovator because he\u2019s not necessarily coming up with original ideas. He\u2019s taking other people\u2019s ideas and turning them into practical propositions.\nEdison said this is a process of 1% inspiration and 99% perspiration. What I\u2019m trying to do in this book is rescue the perspirators from obscurity and slightly relegate the inspirators, who will always think they deserve the most credit, and who sometimes complain about not getting enough reward because it\u2019s their original idea. I like to tell the story that Charles Towns, the inventor of the laser, used to tell, of a rabbit and a beaver looking at the Hoover Dam, and the beaver says to the rabbit, \u201cNo, I didn\u2019t build it, but it\u2019s based on an idea of mine.\u201d That is how inventors quite often think about innovations: \u201cCome on, I had the idea!\u201d But it\u2019s a huge amount of work and talent to turn an idea into something practical.\nNaval: This is something that you learn in Silicon Valley very early on, that ideas are a dime a dozen. Every idea has been floating around. Even a lot of the old ideas that failed weren\u2019t necessarily bad ideas; they were just the wrong time.\nIn 1999, for example, we had the dot-com bubble. We had things like Webvan and Kozmo failed back then, but now we have Instacart, Postmates and DoorDash, which work. We had Pets.com, which crashed, and now we\u2019ve had a big dog food company bought by Amazon for over half a billion dollars. So these things do work\u2014they just need that right structure of previous innovations to build on top of. And sometimes you\u2019re jumping too far ahead. The previous innovations stack or the shoulders that you want to stand on, the giants don\u2019t yet exist, so you\u2019re trying to bootstrap too much.\nMatt: One of the things I\u2019m doing in this book is slightly downplaying the importance of disruption. Most of the time innovation is an incremental process. It looks disruptive when you\u2019re looking backwards. but at the time it\u2019s surprisingly gradual. The first version of a new technology looks surprisingly like the last version of an old technology.\nNaval: This is the misconception about Silicon Valley that you fixed for me. I grew up reading science and scientists, and I originally wanted to be a scientist. But I was never very good. I knew I wasn\u2019t going to be a world-class physicist, and I wanted to make money, so I pivoted into the technology business, which I thought was commercializing science and bringing it to the masses. I came to Silicon Valley thinking that invention was a thing that I\u2019d read about, where a genius inventor comes up with a new invention and it changes the world.\nOliver and Wilbur Wright created the airplane; Samuel Morse created the telegraph; Alexander Graham Bell created the telephone; Newton and Leibniz discovered calculus\u2014without them we would have been stuck in the Dark Ages for god knows how long. That was my view of how the world worked.\n\u201cThere\u2019s an old quip in Silicon Valley that the reason we do well is because we operate in the last unregulated domains.\u201d\nWhen I came to Silicon Valley, I looked around and I didn\u2019t see that happening. I didn\u2019t see a single genius inventor creating a single thing that suddenly changed the world. I saw, instead, lots of people doing lots of tinkering.\nSomewhere in the back of my head, I adopted this mentality that, even though I am in Silicon Valley and even though it is the engine of innovation for the world today\u2014or seems like it\u2014we\u2019re not as innovative as we used to be. We\u2019ve lost the great people; we\u2019ve lost the audacious goals; and we don\u2019t invent new things. The lone inventor has gone away.\nYour book showed me that that was a myth. That lone inventor never existed. Innovation is going on all around us right now, especially in the unregulated domains. There\u2019s an old quip in Silicon Valley that the reason we do well is because we operate in the last unregulated domains. But it didn\u2019t seem to me like there was innovation going on. Now I realize it\u2019s an evolutionary process with lots of people looking at it from different views. Perhaps I am in an innovative industry, but I just can\u2019t see it because I see the evolutionary process eternally, as opposed to the breakthrough process.\nIndividuals vs. Teams\nMatt: I\u2019m delighted to hear that that is what you\u2019re experiencing because I very much set out to make that point. It\u2019s not a case that there was a Golden Age when individuals invented things and nowadays it\u2019s teams that do it. It was always teams, in the sense of collaborators. They weren\u2019t necessarily working for the same institution. Our habit of giving the Nobel Prize or that patent to one individual has tended to pull out the great man of history and put him on a pedestal where he doesn\u2019t necessarily deserve to be. He\u2019s very important, but he\u2019s putting the last stone in the arch and other people built the rest of the arch.\nIn the book I describe one of my heroes, Norman Borlaug, who developed short-strawed, high-yielding varieties of wheat in Mexico and then persuaded India and Pakistan to take them up, and effectively kicked off the Green Revolution, which drove famine largely extinct on the Indian sub-continent and led to India becoming an exporter of food rather than a chronically starving country.\nBut where did he get the idea of these dwarf varieties of wheat which could handle higher applications of fertilizer and therefore produce greater yields? He got it in a bar in Buenos Aires at a conference from Burton Bales, a fairly obscure agronomist who happened to be at this conference but had seen Orville Vogel growing this stuff in Oregon and crossing different varieties.\nOrville Vogel had gotten these varieties from Cecil Salmon, who\u2019d been on Douglas MacArthur\u2019s staff in Tokyo at the end of the war and had visited agricultural stations in Japan and found these dwarf varieties growing. And they had been developed, crossed, hybridized and bred by Gonjiro Inazuka, and he had got them from somewhere in the Korean Peninsula. And at this point the trail goes cold.\nIf you then jump back to Norman Borlaug and say, \u201cYes, but he didn\u2019t persuade India single-handedly. He talked to M.S. Swaminathan, an Indian geneticist who picked the ball up and did a huge amount of work to persuade his countrymen to take up this technology.\u201d So there\u2019s a nice example of what looks like a linear chain of people, but, in a sense, it\u2019s also a team, a collaborative enterprise and a much more gradual story than it would be in the normal way of telling it.\nGeographic Concentration of Innovation\nNaval: This also helps explain why it tends to be geographically concentrated. If it was a breakthrough by lone individuals, you would expect innovation to be highly geographically distributed. But it tends to be very geographically concentrated where you\u2019re surrounded by other inventors, tinkerers and thinkers, because you\u2019re always building on little bits and pieces. We see that in Silicon Valley, where it\u2019s geographically dense and concentrated almost to a level that seems unfair to the rest of the world. One person\u2019s idea at a cocktail party goes to the next person at a coffee shop, goes into a prototype, which goes to a VC, who talks about it with the portfolio company, who then mentions it to another entrepreneur, and so on.\nMatt: I\u2019m amazed by how geographically concentrated innovation is at any one point in history. In the last 50 years it\u2019s been California, but there was a period when it was Victorian Britain. There was a period when it was the low countries. There was a period when it was Renaissance Italy. At some point it was ancient Greece. It was Fujian China for a while. It was probably the Ganges Valley at a different point. Why is the bushfire only burning in one place at one time? The key to this is understanding the ecosystem in which these innovative people operate. Because they\u2019re not only getting ideas from each other, daring each other on to be innovators and experiencing unique aspects of freedom that allow them to do it. They\u2019re also directly borrowing technologies. It became clear to me when I was writing about the harbor process, which fixes nitrogen from the air\u2014a very important process for good and evil in terms of making explosives, but also in terms of making fertilizer\u2014that it couldn\u2019t have happened without all the other industries around it in Germany that were producing the high-quality metals and chemicals that were necessary for this process. The same will be true in Silicon Valley: One idea won;t work without the neighboring company producing devices and programs that are necessary in developing your idea.\nNaval: Now it\u2019s gotten to another level where, when you first create an innovation and launch a new product, you need customers. The early-adopter customers tend to be other innovative companies. In Silicon Valley we have a critical mass of thousands of innovative companies that will adopt products from each other, so you not only find your innovator base and your talent base in one place, but you also find your customer base in one place. That network effect ends up being very tight and, of course, the local politicians exploit it with high taxes and low services, constantly attacking and blaming technology for all evils, but it works for them because this has turned into the golden goose. It\u2019s the oil reservoir that will always be gushing, so they can get away with a lot.\nMatt: Until it no longer is gushing. One of the patterns of innovators is that they move. They move from uncongenial regimes to congenial ones. The secret of Europe when it was at its most innovative was that it was fragmented politically. It\u2019s very hard to unify Europe because of all the mountain ranges and peninsulas. So, you end up with lots of different countries. A lot of the innovative people like Gutenberg, the pioneer of printing, had to move from his hometown to another town to find a regime that would allow him. The same is true, I reckon, of China during the Song dynasty, which is the period when it was most innovative. It was a surprisingly decentralized empire at the time. And it was possible for people to move around and escape from local rule that wasn\u2019t promising.\nAmerica is the exception that seems to prove this rule. Although it looks like an empire from the outside\u2014a great, big unified country\u2014once you get inside it you find that California has a quite different regime from other parts. Even this week, Elon Musk was talking about leaving California and moving to Texas because he\u2019s so upset with the way they\u2019re treating the end of lockdown. It\u2019s like a 15th Century European innovator threatening to leave one part of Germany for another part of Germany.\nCrypto\nNaval: For a long time I had thought, despite the poor political governance, California was impregnable. It had too much of a network effect; the lock was too strong. But now I can see the cracks.\nThis pandemic, of course, is accelerating things, forcing people to work remotely. Twitter recently announced they\u2019re going fully remote. Many of the companies that I\u2019ve been involved with are wondering, \u201cShould we even go back to having an office?\u201d I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if the next Silicon Valley moves to the cloud. That would be an incredibly good thing for all of humanity, because then we could distribute it. Obviously, some things can\u2019t move to the cloud. You can\u2019t have a semiconductor manufacturing plant in the cloud, but a lot of the initial coordination, invention, social networking, conversation, design work can happen in the cloud.\nThere is recent precedent for this. I don\u2019t know how much you\u2019ve been tracking the crypto revolution, but crypto obviously went through its big hype cycle a few years ago. At this point there\u2019s a lot of innovation going on in crypto. We\u2019re now in that silent under-the-radar phase where great entrepreneurs are building great products that will be more widely deployed in the next 5 to 10 years. What\u2019s interesting about crypto is that it\u2019s truly geographically distributed. Some of the biggest innovators in crypto are scattered all around the world. More than half of my crypto investments are outside of the Bay area, which is not true of any other class of investment that I do. Many of the top crypto innovators are anonymous, like Satoshi Nakamoto famously.\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t be surprised if the next Silicon Valley moves to the cloud.\u201d\nCrypto companies raise money in public, in plain sight, by issuing tokens so they\u2019re not locked into the Sand Hill Road venture capital model. The crypto system is starting with finance but is laying the foundation for future companies to be built completely distributed with potentially anonymous contributors, anonymous funding, anonymous cash and anonymous developers. There\u2019s even a Holy Grail of crypto called autonomous organization, which are these companies that are smart contracts living in the block chain completely extra-sovereign outside of the state, able to engage in contract laws, contract enforcement, payments, dividends, investment, equity, debt, payouts, reputations and reconstructing the corporation\u2014but modernizing it from the Magna Carta days to a modern code-based system living on a mathematical, reputation-based, anonymous blockchain.\nI wouldn\u2019t be surprised if 10 years from now that the rest of the tech industry is just as distributed as the crypto industry is today. California and the Bay area will still do fine. They will still be a hub. I don\u2019t believe that innovators will get priced out of the Bay area, because innovators are the highest earners in history; they\u2019re the most leveraged people. They\u2019re leveraged through code, capital, media, labor, intelligence\u2014they can create more than everybody else on a per capita basis. So they can always afford to live wherever they want to live. They won\u2019t be forced out by prices, but they may be forced out by regulations. They may be forced out by not being able to go to work because the government forbids them. They may be forced out because the place is no longer attractive to live\nIf they are forced out, it would be amazing for everybody if they moved the cloud rather than to another physical location from which we may be displaced. In the examples that you gave, they\u2019re punctuated. In between each one of them, there\u2019s 50, 100, 200 years that pass where there is no place to innovate. Therefore, the rate of innovation collapses. So if innovation is the flower of a well-tended garden, if you have to uproot those flowers and shift them, there is a huge deadweight loss to society when, for decades or perhaps even centuries, we have to wait for another garden to emerge and for people to coalesce there for this right magic soup of deregulation combined with innovators, good weather and a rich society\u2014 all of that has to assemble.\nMatt: Thank you very much for that, because that has filled in a gap in my understanding in one go. I\u2019ve always been interested in the fact that these innovation bush fires eventually are extinguished by some combination of chiefs, priests and thieves, if you like.\nNaval: I like that: chiefs, priests and thieves. Or, as a wag might say, \u201cChiefs, priests and thieves\u2014what\u2019s the difference?\u201d\nPolitical Fragmentation and Innovation\nMatt: Right, exactly. So, in Ming China it\u2019s a very, restrictive authoritarian and interfering political regime that kills the goose that\u2019s laying the golden eggs. In Abbasid Arabia, not hugely different in the time period\u2014we\u2019re talking about 1100s\u2014a great, flowering of knowledge and innovation is crushed by a religious fundamentalist revival when Islam goes from being a very open-minded to a very closed-minded structure. Something similar is happening in Paris around the same time. Bernard of Clairvaux was burning books. I singled that out in a previous book as a period when it\u2019s possible the world could\u2019ve lost this habit all together. It could\u2019ve given up on innovation everywhere. The flame would\u2019ve been extinguished.\n\u201cWhat if America does lose its mojo and we have to rely on China for the world\u2019s innovation engine?\u201d\nFortunately, the Italian city-states kept the flame burning. I write about Fibonacci, the Italian merchant who brings Indian numerals from North Africa back to Italy, and they spread around the world. It\u2019s lucky that somewhere keeps the show on the road at each stage in history, but it\u2019s not accidental. These are people escaping the other regime and starting it again. But I did worry that, in the old days, there was always somewhere else to go and in this global world. You could imagine a sufficiently benighted cult taking over the entire world and saying, \u201cNo, we don\u2019t want learning, innovation and technology. We want to stop everything.\u201d\nIt\u2019s very unlikely, but what if America does lose its mojo and we have to rely on China for the world\u2019s innovation engine? China is not a free place. It\u2019s a politically dictatorial regime, albeit there\u2019s a certain amount of freedom for entrepreneurs below the level of politics. If that\u2019s our only hope, it\u2019s not a great prospect. Maybe India can pick up the pattern. Europes not great at picking up the pattern at the moment; it\u2019s not a very innovative continent. It\u2019s trying to centralize all its decision making through the European Union.\nBut India has done this before. It was probably the first place to start all this going. A place of free thought and a lot of spontaneous order\u2014 a lot of spontaneous disorder, too. Maybe that\u2019s the place. But you\u2019ve given me another prospect, which is this escape from the chiefs, priests and thieves into the cloud where it can be out of their reach for at least long enough until they work out how to reach it.\nNaval: I think the digital innovation can escape into the cloud. Obviously, physical innovation requires physical infrastructure, and that would depend on the enlightened city state, a Switzerland type place or Hong Kong. A Singapore or a New Zealand. But then you have the small-market problem. You don\u2019t have many early adopters of the technology. Although you can build a prototype, you can\u2019t deploy it in volume. I do think physical innovation is in trouble, and you talk about this in the book. The speed of innovation has been very low in some places. For example, we can\u2019t travel any faster than we used to. Why is that? It\u2019s mostly for regulatory reasons.\nOne underlying theme running this whole book is innovation is a process of evolution. Like any process of evolution, it requires trial and error. Innovation happens by taking the body of innovators that surround you one step further, engaging in lots of trials and then having error and feedback from customers and the economy. All of those pieces are necessary. You need to have a body of innovators around you, which means there has to be a place where they can all gather, whether it\u2019s online or offline.\nThere has to be the ability to take lots of tries. You need venture capital. You need start-ups. You need a friendly environment to start a business. We don\u2019t like people making errors anymore, so we try to cover the downside risk. But by doing that we\u2019ve also cut off the upside. Finally, you need the feedback loop from the environment, and part of that involves a large customer base.\n\u201cCalifornia doesn\u2019t create entrepreneurs. California attracts entrepreneurs.\u201d\nSo I\u2019m optimistic that we can do this in the digital domain. I can see that happening in crypto, for example. But I\u2019m a little pessimistic in the physical domain, which is unfortunate because a lot of the big problems of humanity that we have to solve\u2014like the energy problem, getting nuclear fusion working at large scale or the transportation problem, moving people around quickly with hypersonic jets, or even some of the biotech problems\u2014these require physical infrastructure and large markets that are relatively deregulated. So I think you\u2019re right that we\u2019re down to India and China\u2014and neither of those is ideal. China is not going to be a place where the next Jew fleeing the Nazis is going to go because China is not an integration destination. It doesn\u2019t attract the best and brightest.\nCalifornia doesn\u2019t create entrepreneurs. California attracts entrepreneurs. China is not going to be an attractor, and it will always be limited because of that. Even though India has a lot of the other elements, it doesn\u2019t have the basic infrastructure to make it an attractive place to go. Because of its poverty level, India also has a very anti-innovation culture. Innovators in India often survive by keeping their heads down. You can see this in how India banned crypto. Hopefully that\u2019ll get overturned, but they can do things like that. Early on something got listed on eBay India that wasn\u2019t supposed to be listed, so they just rounded up the local eBay managers and threw them in jail.\nThe history of India fostering innovation recently has not been great. That said, there is a flowering going on right now in places like Bangalore, Mumbai and Delhi. Hopefully, as India gets richer and is run by a more competent government, we\u2019re going to see them step out of the way and allow India to become an innovation hub. The market there is large enough; they\u2019re poor enough that they could welcome it; they speak English; they\u2019re very well educated; there\u2019s a deep respect for STEM\u2014so India could be one of these hubs. But they would also need immigration and clean, beautiful places where people want to live. Innovators are going to go live where they want to live because they\u2019re so productive.\nYou said something else very interesting: What about people who may create a global movement to stop innovation? That is very scary and very possible. Take environmentalism for example. It runs on two tracks today. There\u2019s local environmentalism that everybody can get behind\u2014clean up my rivers, save the species, I want trees, forests and parks. Everybody likes that. Then it gets mixed into this global command and control environmentalism, which says, \u201cYou must stop progress. you must stop innovation, you must stop everything because you\u2019re destroying the environment.\u201d One of the things that you talk about in your book is how the world is refreshing, how innovation allows us to do more with less, and how we\u2019ve become much more efficient as a society.\nWe\u2019re not going to be able to stop India and China from growing. We\u2019re not going to be able to stop them from innovating. We\u2019re not going to be able to stop them from modernizing. We can do what Elon Musk does: He says let me give them solar-powered electric cars and rockets as quickly as possible so they can jump through the wasteful phase of innovation, where there\u2019s a lot of environmental destruction, and get to the part where we can all afford clean rivers beautiful forests, nice parks and other species in our environment. By the way, I credit this to Genome. The book paints a picture of utopia.\nNot in the sense of a top-down, human-enforced, platonic sense of this is how the world should be run, but in how the natural world is designed and operates, and our role in it. Genome paints a picture of paradise being a garden. This is in our deeply embedded myths: The paradise that Adam and Eve live in is a garden. They fall from grace, and they fall out of the garden.\nToday in Covid-19 land, where do you want to be living? In your little apartment in New York city or a little flat in London? Or do you want to be sitting in a beautiful garden out in the sunshine? Humans inherently want a clean and beautiful environment, but that movement gets hacked by top-down command-and-control mechanisms by chiefs, priests and thieves who can then squander our existing resources as well as squash innovation, which prevents us from moving forward.", "sentiment": 0.873, "pageUrl": "https://nav.al/matt-ridley", "date": "Wed, 08 Jul 2020 23:00:00 GMT", "person": "naval_ravikant"}, {"title": "How to Angel Invest, Part 2", "text": "We have another podcast called Spearhead, where we discuss startups and angel investing. This is a compilation of recent episodes. Also, see Part 1.\nEverybody Thinks They Already Have Good Judgment\nIt takes years to know if you have good judgment\nNivi: For the past few episodes, we talked about why you should angel invest and how to get proprietary dealflow by building a brand. Now let\u2019s talk about judgment: how important it is and how to develop it.\nGood entrepreneurs don\u2019t want to be associated with bad judgment\nNaval: In the long-term, having good judgment is critical. Without it, you\u2019ll end up with a bad portfolio; other investors won\u2019t back you; you\u2019ll lose your money; and your brand will suffer. Good entrepreneurs don\u2019t want to be associated with bad judgment.\nAt the end of the day, judgment is the single most important thing. It\u2019s more important than access to deals and access to capital.\nIf you have poor judgment, you won\u2019t know it\nThe problem with judgment: Everybody thinks they already have it. That\u2019s because your ability to assess your own judgment is subject to your level of judgment.\nIf you have poor judgment, you won\u2019t know it. This cognitive bias is called the Dunning-Kruger effect after psychologists who popularized the idea. It\u2019s also common sense. People who are not that intelligent usually don\u2019t know it. It\u2019s partly an ego defense mechanism.\nIt takes five to 15 years to know if you have good judgment\nFurthermore, you might have good judgment in certain areas and poor judgment in others. You might have good people judgment but lack market judgment. The only way to know is to look over a long period of time. Unfortunately, in early-stage investing it takes five to 15 years to figure out if you have good judgment.\nThe first thing to do is be honest with yourself about your own judgment. We\u2019ll walk through a plan to calibrate and improve your judgment over the long-term.\nJudgment Gives You the Winning Lottery Numbers in Advance\nBut you still need a portfolio effect to be successful\nNaval: At the seed stage, judgment is much more about people judgment, product potential and market potential than your ability to size up cashflows, customer acquisition costs or virality metrics\u2014because you don\u2019t have much data.\nDiversification is a hedge against lack of knowledge\nWhen you have less data, you need a more diversified portfolio. In some sense, diversification is a hedge against the lack of knowledge.\nWarren Buffett can examine in detail a company that\u2019s been around for 20 years. Judgment still applies, but he can pick one deal after doing diligence on many. With seed-stage startups, you have very little data. You might have to rely on other people\u2019s judgment, which is why social proof plays such a big role.\nNobody has enough data to have high conviction at the seed-stage\nTo be successful in early-stage investing, you\u2019re going to have to build a portfolio, because nobody has enough data to have high conviction or fool-proof judgment early on.\nWhen he was posting as @StartupLJackson on Twitter, Parker Thompson wrote: \u201cEveryone who invests after me is a spreadsheet jockey, and everyone who invests before me is a dart-throwing monkey.\u201d I thought that was very appropriate.\nLater-stage investors look at seed investors as making wild guesses. And seed investors look at later-stage investors as spreadsheet jockeys.\nBut they\u2019re just applying different levels and types of judgment, because they have different data available to them. They\u2019re going to have different size portfolios and conviction because of the judgment they can apply.\nJudgment gives you the winning lottery numbers in advance\nNivi: Given the amount of luck involved at the seed stage, how important is judgment?\nNaval: Investing at the seed stage is like playing the lottery\u2014except that you can use your access and judgment to get some of the winning numbers in advance. The better your judgment, the more numbers you know in advance. This increases your odds, but you still need a portfolio effect to be successful.\nSo it\u2019s crucial to cultivate and hone your judgment. This is a long-term game that will be played out over dozens\u2014and eventually hundreds\u2014of investments.\nJudgment Is the Work You Do Before a Deal Arrives\nOver time you\u2019ll need less data to assess a deal\nNivi: Given how quickly deals move, how much time do I really have to apply judgment? Won\u2019t I miss out if I take time to think things through?\nNaval: Judgment isn\u2019t necessarily due diligence or even thinking. Judgment is the preparation you do before a deal arrives so that your subconscious can process it quickly.\nEarly-stage investing is more about gut feel than due diligence\nJudgment for early-stage investing doesn\u2019t involve extensive due diligence. Yes, it\u2019s smart to check references, talk to other people and think it through. But that takes days, not weeks. Over time you will build up a gut instinct, and you will require less and less data to assess a deal.\nYou\u2019ll know if a founder is credible by listening to them. You\u2019ll know if they come from a credible network, which means you can spend less time checking references. You\u2019ll know how customers in the space think and you\u2019ll develop a gut feel for what founders can sell them.\nThe best investors are immune to FOMO\nStartups are now trained to run a tight, fast fundraising process. This is especially true for startups coming out of accelerators. Some of them pressure you hard to make a decision.\nThe best investors are immune to the FOMO effect. If you push them to decide within 48 hours, they\u2019ll say, \u201cWell, I don\u2019t decide within 48 hours, so it\u2019s not a fit for me.\u201d They won\u2019t look at it, even if it\u2019s a hot deal.\nFOMO works on many investors\u2014up to a point. I employ a 24-hour cooling off period for deals I consider. Even after I decide to invest, I force myself to wait 24 hours before moving forward.\nPivots Mean Your People Judgment Really Matters\nBets on seed-stage startups are bets on founders\nNivi: How is an investor supposed to know which companies to invest in, given how much they can pivot?\nNaval: Since companies often pivot, your people judgment really matters. A pivot means keeping one leg in place and moving the other one around. It\u2019s not a jump or a leap into a completely different industry.\nOftentimes a company pivots into an adjacent space, so it\u2019s still operating within the broader market. In that case, you\u2019ll give more weight to evaluating the team and execution and give less weight to the exact product approach, assuming the market has enough room to pivot around.\nThe valuation should reflect that the company might go through pivots, and the company\u2019s cash burn and cash planning should, too.\nNivi: Here are some examples of soft and hard pivots: Twitter started off as Odeo; Instagram was Burbn; Slack was Glitch; and Lyft was Zimride. Uber started off with just black cars.\nNaval: Uber\u2019s move from black cars to shared rides wasn\u2019t a pivot; it was an extension. Zimride\u2019s move from long-range shared rides to short-range shared rides also was an extension\u2014and a brilliant innovation on their part.\nOdeo to Twitter was a pivot, but it wasn\u2019t a jump. It was a pivot from podcasting to micro-blogging by the person who popularized blogging as we know it, Evan Williams. It was a bet on a great individual who was staying within his space.\nBurbn to Instagram was barely a pivot; it was more of a step. Now, Geni to Yammer was a jump. David Sacks is one of the greatest product designers we\u2019ve ever seen. He was early at PayPal, pivoted Geni into Yammer, and ran Zenefits. He was an early investor in some of the greatest hits out there. Geni was a David bet, similar to an Elon Musk bet. The people who bet on David would bet on him all day long.\nGlitch to Slack was another jump. Glitch was a gaming company, but Stewart Butterfield had done something similar before. if I remember correctly. Even his first hit, Flickr, had also been a jump of sorts. People were investing in Stewart and hoping for the best\u2014and he delivered.\nBut for every one of those, there\u2019s 10 failures.\nAre Good Investors Piling in the Round with You?\nIt\u2019s a sign of good judgment when proven investors pile into the round\nNaval: When you want to develop your judgment, the first step is to calibrate it: Do I have good judgment or not?\nIt would be great if you could look at the results of your investments and see if you were correct. But you won\u2019t know for 10 or 15 years, and the industry will have changed by then because it evolves and adapts quickly.\nLook at markups in subsequent rounds\nYou can look at intermediate markups, noting when Sequoia, Andreessen or Benchmark invest in subsequent rounds and pay higher prices. That\u2019s an interesting metric, although it really indicates your taste in what other tastes makers like.\nIt\u2019s a Keynesian beauty contest where each judge is rewarded based on what the judge in the next round thinks. If your deals are marked up, it means you\u2019re becoming a good arbiter of future taste.\nThat kind of judgment is a people proxy mechanism; it\u2019s not really a way to build and calibrate your own judgment. Though it does have value: If you can predict what VCs will fund, your companies have a better chance of getting funded, which gives them a competitive advantage.\nBut being an arbiter of investor taste won\u2019t help you with a deal like Bitcoin, where it\u2019s incredibly strange, nobody understands it and there\u2019s no subsequent round of VC funding to bet on. You have to make the decision yourself.\nAre good investors piling in the round with you?\nYou can also look at which investors follow you in the same round. If they commit before you, it\u2019s not a reflection of your judgement because you\u2019re probably keying off of them. But if good investors with proven judgment pile into the same round after you, that is a reasonable indication of good judgment.\nAsk people about your weaknesses\nFinally, you can ask people. Don\u2019t ask them if you have good judgment or not, because polite people will always tell you yes. Rather, ask them about your weaknesses. Of course, only ask people if they have good judgment themselves.\nJudgment Requires a Willingness to Be Unpopular\nGroupthink leads to poor judgment\nNaval: People with good judgment tend to demonstrate it in all aspects of life.\nThey are well read, think critically and hold a broad range of ideas and opinions, including conflicting ones. People with good judgement are humble and have a relatively low ego, so they don\u2019t get too attached to earlier decisions. They constantly question themselves.\nOften, they have scientific or other technical training and work in industries where they deal with real-world, consequential feedback and not just what people think of them.\nGroupthink leads to poor judgement\nPeople with good judgement are willing to be unpopular. The clearest thinkers work from the ground up and use first principles in their reasoning. They end up relying on their own authority.\nThings that lead to poor judgment: groupthink, over-socialization of judgment and picking things because they are politically or socially popular. Lots of people lose money in this business chasing things they wish were true, as opposed to what actually turns out to be true.\nThe \u201cPayPal mafia\u201d is famous for being insular. They all have good judgment, they\u2019re all strange and politically incorrect\u2014and they\u2019re all brilliant. They\u2019re not afraid to hold unpopular views, and they value each other\u2019s insights and judgment.\nWhatever people say about Peter Thiel, no one wants to go head-to-head with him in a debate because he\u2019s brilliant and a contrary thinker. He\u2019s a first principles thinker from the ground up.\nIf you surround yourself with brilliant, contrary and first principles thinkers, you will develop extremely good judgment; however, you may not end up very popular.\nThe Best Deals Look Weird\nYou want to be right when everybody else is wrong\nNaval: In investing, you want to be non-consensus right. You want to be right when everybody else is wrong. If you\u2019re right when everybody else is right, you won\u2019t make enough of a return. If you\u2019re wrong, you won\u2019t make any return.\nThe best deals have something broken, strange or different\nThe best deals are weird. They always have something broken, strange or different about them.\nThey\u2019re socially unacceptable, outside the norms of venture capital or too niche to be interesting. The founder doesn\u2019t fit the normal mold, or they\u2019re in the wrong city. Or they have a cap table problem. And so on.\nThat doesn\u2019t mean you should only invest in weird deals. It\u2019s like the old saying, \u201cThere\u2019s a fine line between genius and madness.\u201d The genius and madman both seem crazy until the genius is validated. One out of 100 turns out to be a genius; the other 99 turn out to be crazy.\nYou have to be iconoclastic enough to recognize genius founders without being so low in judgment that you let in all the crazy ones too.\nPatri Friedman is making weird investments\nThe way portfolios are constructed, you may be better off investing in a lot of crazy deals than a lot of decent looking deals.\nTo give a recent example: Patri Friedman started a fund called Promonos Capital. He\u2019s investing in experiments in governance: new city states, towns and localities. These are places where people are taking local government into their own hands and doing experiments in governance.\nThis seems impossibly difficult to do. The history with seasteading in Honduras doesn\u2019t look great. But all you have to do is stumble into the next Singapore or Hong Kong\u2014whether it\u2019s virtual or physical\u2014and you have something that can create trillions of dollars in wealth and change the way people live.\nPromons benefits from two things. First, they have a unique brand because nobody else is doing that. Everybody interested in this space knows to go to them. Second, the vast majority of their investments are going to look mad\u2014but the few genius outliers should have huge returns because they\u2019re non-consensus investments.\nSimilarly, Founders Fund, Steve Jurvetson and a variety of other people built their brands by being willing to fund weird deals long before anybody else.\nYou Can Give Every Deal One Fatal Flaw\nA startup that breaks all the rules won\u2019t get anywhere\nNaval: You can give every deal one fatal flaw: the thing that traditional venture capitalists will use as their excuse to pass on the deal. If there\u2019s more than one flaw, you have to worry.\nA startup that breaks all the rules won\u2019t get anywhere\nStartups are rewarded for innovating on something new. If you invest in a startup that\u2019s trying to innovate on things that already work\u2014such as team structure or founder mentality\u2014you\u2019re just taking on additional risk.\nYou have to use your judgment to figure out when a startup can break the rules and when they can\u2019t. A startup that follows all the rules probably won\u2019t be interesting. A startup that breaks all the rules won\u2019t get anywhere, because they have to reinvent everything from scratch.\nUber was strange when it first came along, because investors considered it a taxi business and they didn\u2019t invest in offline industries back then.\nTo them it looked like the app was 5% of it and the other 95% was people driving cars\u2014and they were correct. The question, though, is how much leverage accrues to the company that owns the app and how much can they expand the market with the app by introducing new products, attracting new customers and creating convenience.\nGoogle was strange because everyone thought the search wars had already been won by the time they showed up.\nBreaking the rules is easier when you understand technology\nTo know which rules to break, it helps to understand technology. As an investor, the best position is this: Others pass on a deal because they don\u2019t understand the technology, and you have enough technical insight to know it\u2019s feasible. Then, you have to make sure you can get it funded to the point where it\u2019s obvious to everybody.\nThe value comes in breaking the \u201crule\u201d that you know isn\u2019t a rule, while everyone else thinks it is.\nYou\u2019ll Get Less Money in Your Winners\nAlways try to get your standard bite-size in a deal\nNaval: It\u2019s easy to overestimate your own judgment. It\u2019s perfectly OK to say, \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d That should be your answer most of the time.\nThere\u2019s only a few deals where you should say, \u201cI have conviction.\u201d And, even then, be careful how much conviction you have.\nAt the seed stage, if you put a lot of money into one company and very little into another, that begs the question: \u201cDo you really have conviction, or do you simply have better access to one deal?\u201d\nGenerally, the better the deal, the less access you\u2019ll have.\nAlways try to get your standard bite-size\nIf you put a lot of money into a few deals and little money into many others, you\u2019ll find that your winners tend to come disproportionately out of the deals with little money invested. And that will hurt your portfolio return.\nOnce you have conviction, always try to get your standard bite into that deal. If a deal has too much space for you, that means: Either you should invest more in other deals or less in this one, or you should get rewarded with a lower valuation because you\u2019re creating the signal that the company will use to raise the bulk of the money.\nAnyone chasing hot markets gets killed\nAnyone in this business who\u2019s chasing hot markets gets killed.\nIf you started seed investing when the consumer social market was hot, the market was done by the time your investments matured.\nIf you invested in the masses of food delivery companies that showed up once it became obvious Uber was winning\u2014if you invested in companies five through 50\u2014you lost your money.\nIf you invested in crypto in 2017, you hit the tail end of the market; the early side was 2009 to 2015.\nToday, SaaS is hot. It\u2019s a proven moneymaker. Let\u2019s see how it plays out. When current seed-stage SaaS investments mature in five to 10 years, you may find the returns are a lot lower than they are today. It\u2019s good to be at the beginning of a market\u2014not at the tail end. By the time you see conferences about it and read TechCrunch articles about it, it\u2019s probably too late.\nDon\u2019t Fantasize About What You Would Do If You Were the Founder\nYou\u2019re not running the company\u2014you\u2019re betting on the founder\nNaval: A common trap for investors\u2014especially if you\u2019re an entrepreneur\u2014is to fantasize about the things you could do with the company if you were the founder. You\u2019ll learn the painful lesson that it\u2019s actually the entrepreneur who\u2019s running the company.\nIt\u2019s important to listen carefully and take the founder at their word about what they plan to do. Don\u2019t get caught up in the idea that somebody else is going to run the company.\nAngel investing is the opposite of value investing. Warren Buffett says, \u201cBuy into a business that\u2019s doing so well an idiot could run it, because sooner or later, one will.\u201d That\u2019s not the case with startups.\nWith most startups, almost all the value creation happens while the founder is intimately involved. So you\u2019re betting on the founder.\nIf you bet on a founder you\u2019re not excited about even though you\u2019re excited about the market or product, often the founder will fumble the company or a competitor will come along with a much better founder. When that happens, either you\u2019ll be conflicted from investing in the new company or the new founder won\u2019t want to talk to you because you invested in a competitor.\nInvest in the Smartest Scientists in a New Field\nYou\u2019re not going to become a great tech investor by reading TechCrunch\nNaval: There are many ways to build good judgment. The timeless kind of judgment\u2014good decision-making and the ability to size people up\u2014comes with experience. You can develop it by reading great works at the intersection of science, business and philosophy. Read books that cover how smart people think. Build so-called \u201cmental models\u201d and develop an understanding of microeconomics, mathematics and game theory.\nYou\u2019re not going to become a great investor by reading TechCrunch\nYou can build timely specific knowledge in a field by diving in and learning everything you can about it, as quickly as possible.\nYou won\u2019t become a great tech investor by reading about technology on TechCrunch or Bloomberg News. You have to go to the source. You shouldn\u2019t hesitate to read scientific papers and journals. You should brush up on your mathematics. You should genuinely enjoy the act of learning science and technology. After all, technology is applied science.\nInvest in the smartest scientists in a new field\nYou can also develop good judgment by investing in the smartest scientists and technologists in the space. Even if they don\u2019t make you money, they can perform due diligence for you on deals. They can validate and calibrate deals for you, and they can send other great scientists your way. Perhaps you\u2019ll make them advisors to your fund, give them a piece of your carry, or let them invest with you.\nI did this early on, when I invested in cryptocurrency companies. I became friends with Zooko Wilcox-O\u2019Hearn, who started Zcash; Juan Benet, who started Filecoin; Ryan Shea and Muneeb Ali, who started Blockstack together; Bram Cohen, who started BitTorrent; Eli Ben-Sasson; and Andrew Miller. They became my go-to people for vetting and validating deals. They told me which technologies were real and which ones weren\u2019t; and which scientists were credible and which ones weren\u2019t.\nScientists and technologists are a secret weapon\nIf you surround yourself with top scientists and technologists, they will become your secret weapon. They tend to be no bullshit\u2014they\u2019ll tell you exactly what they think of a new technology. And they\u2019ll refer you to their networks.\nYou\u2019ll need to use your own judgment to decide when they\u2019re being unnecessarily negative or jealous, because that\u2019s human nature. Overall, very technical people tend to be extremely objective. They\u2019re used to corresponding with the real world and scientific results, rather than people who are influenced by subjectivity.\nIf you can find a group of painfully honest and distinguished scientists and technologists, that will be a secret weapon throughout your investing career.\nInvest Only in Technical Teams\nIf there\u2019s no technical team, you\u2019re not investing in technology\nNivi: Let\u2019s discuss how judgment applies to evaluating teams, product and market, traction, and social proof.\nEvery great founding team has a great technologist\nNaval: This is the technology business; you want to invest in technology teams. Every great tech startup is highly likely to have a great technologist on its founding team. If they aren\u2019t the most important member of the team, the technologist must be sufficiently compensated and motivated. Their name and accountability must be critical to the project.\nIf there\u2019s no strong technical person on the founding team, either it\u2019s not a technology business or the company has outsourced that function\u2014which is not just a yellow flag; it\u2019s a red flag. For example, I don\u2019t consider Dollar Shave Club a technology business.\nOf course, you can make money investing in non-technology businesses like Dollar Shave Club or Chipotle, but that\u2019s not what we\u2019re talking about here.\nIf you\u2019re not building, you\u2019re selling\nAnyone on the founding team who\u2019s not highly technical should be great at selling: to end users of the product; to investors while raising money; and to potential employees to recruit talent.\nA community builder is another character that can be incredibly useful, though good ones are rare. They sell, too. Only, they\u2019re good at mass sales instead of one-on-one sales. Like growth hackers, they\u2019re a unique combination of building and selling.\nGreat community builders are high leverage, but they\u2019re also extremely difficult to find. They\u2019re probably the rarest thing right now. Everyone claims they\u2019re good at community building, but you need to see the results.\nYou\u2019re Not Investing in Nice People\nInvest in people with high energy, intelligence and integrity\nNaval: I use Warren Buffett\u2019s three-part test for qualities you want in a partner: high energy, high intelligence and high integrity.\nStartups are the Olympics of business\nHigh energy is obvious. You have to work hard, because startups are the Olympics of business and you\u2019re competing against the best in the world. To paraphrase \u201cGlengarry Glen Ross\u201d: first prize gets a Cadillac Eldorado; second prize gets a set of steak knives; and third place gets fired. If you\u2019re going to win, you need people who put in everything.\nThere\u2019s a meme on Twitter that you should work 9 to 5 all the time, and that\u2019s work-life balance. That\u2019s fine; not everybody should kill themselves at work. But then I\u2019d argue that you shouldn\u2019t be an Olympic athlete or a founder of a winner-take-all technology startup.\nIf you\u2019re doing a startup, you and the rest of the core team will have to work your tails off.\nBe a snob about intelligence\nHigh intelligence is important, because you need good decision-makers. Intelligence isn\u2019t just about broad judgment; it\u2019s also about moment-to-moment judgment.\nIf you invest in people who aren\u2019t of the same intellectual caliber as you, then you\u2019re essentially investing down, talking down and thinking down. You\u2019re picking the wrong people.\nIntegrity gets tested when the stakes are high\nHigh integrity is critical. If you don\u2019t have that, you end up with a smart and hardworking crook who can easily cheat you\u2014and there\u2019s so many ways to get cheated in this business.\nIntegrity takes a long time to figure out. It\u2019s hard to assess someone\u2019s integrity if you haven\u2019t worked with them for a long time, which will be the case with most founders. You can observe how they treat people around them, including prospective investors, co-founders and employees. Someone who self-deals with others eventually will cross you.\nFounders don\u2019t necessarily need to be nice people. Niceness is a signal that\u2019s easily faked. It\u2019s not enough of a filter. Technical people tend to know that, so they don\u2019t overemphasize niceness. It may be important to you, because you\u2019ve decided it\u2019s more enjoyable to work with someone who\u2019s nice. But there are plenty of successful business people who are not nice.\nSeek integrity over niceness. Integrity means living up to an internal moral code of ethics. It\u2019s being reliable and honest. Niceness often is just politeness or someone sending off signals that they have integrity when the stakes are low. Integrity gets tested when the stakes are high.\nCoachability Is Overrated\nGreat founders listen to lots of advice and follow little of it\nNaval: There\u2019s a meme among venture capitalists\u2014especially inexperienced ones\u2014that a good founder should be coachable. These investors rely too much on their own abilities, thinking they\u2019re right and founders are wrong.\nInexperienced investors also rely too much on the idea that you can change people in the short-term. Experienced investors know this isn\u2019t the case.\nIn fact, great founders aren\u2019t that coachable. They listen to lots of advice, but they follow very little of it. They develop their own internal compass. So I believe that coachability is an overrated metric.\nYour Reputation Is Built by the Companies That Are Doing Poorly\nDon\u2019t invest so much that you\u2019ll behave badly when things get rough\nNaval: Angel investors tend to be on the tough side when they get started, especially when investing a lot of their own money.\nGenerally, you don\u2019t want to invest money that you\u2019re not OK losing. If you have too much at risk in any deal, you\u2019ll engage in bad behavior when things get rough. When the company performs poorly, you\u2019ll behave poorly. Emotionally, you won\u2019t be able to help it, and it\u2019ll damage your reputation.\nYour reputation is built by the companies that are doing poorly\nYour reputation gets built in those moments. Your returns get built by the companies that are doing well. Your reputation gets built by the companies that are doing poorly.\nIn the long term, your returns also depend on your access. And your access depends on how you behaved with founders when companies were doing poorly.\nAs a consequence, you never want to have too much at risk. So don\u2019t put down so much that you care.\nFounders Almost Can\u2019t Be Referenced\nA founder who\u2019s great for one business may be terrible for another\nNaval: Some angels insist on checking references of founders. This can work if you know what you\u2019re doing, but reference checking is an art that most people haven\u2019t mastered.\nFounding a startup is an act of creativity. If you think of the great writers, philosophers and artists throughout history, honest references would tell you they\u2019re all crazy.\nFounders are non-fungible; they\u2019re irreplaceable. A founder who\u2019s great for one business may be terrible for another. The founder who can build Craigslist\u2014community-oriented, extremely patient and almost anti-capitalistic\u2014won\u2019t work for a financial startup that\u2019s racing to raise and deploy lots of capital while pitching banks and regulators. So, it\u2019s the right founder for the right job.\nReferences tend to be generic. They don\u2019t work as well for assessing founders as they do for hiring employees, where you\u2019re looking for someone to scale processes that already work.\nI passed on Twilio because of a reference\nI passed on Twilio in the seed round because of a reference\u2014big mistake. The reference came from somebody I trusted who had good intentions. It was probably even accurate, but that was beside the point. I should have gone with my gut feeling that Jeff Lawson was the right founder for the job.\nI also passed on Ethereum very early because of a reference from a VC who was active in the space. The reference dissuaded me in a way that it shouldn\u2019t have\u2014though I clued into that one later.\nReferences can devolve into checklists\nReferences from VCs are among the worst type. For every deal a VC does, other VCs passed on that very same deal. Sequoia does a lot of deals that Andreessen has passed on, and vice versa. This goes up and down the chain.\nThe best deals aren\u2019t always chased by the best VCs. In this market, everyone has their own unique point of view, and the good players have very independent points of view.\nReferences can devolve into checklists: \u201cI better check the box that I\u2019ve done all these references.\u201d Or, if you do listen, your point of view becomes a smeared average, diluted by what other people think.\nAvoid Teams That Would Sell Early\nVenture capital is a grand slam business\nNaval: Angel investing is a game of exceptional outcomes; it\u2019s not a game of averages. You\u2019re better off with a portfolio in which nine out of 10 investments go to zero and the 10th one goes 1,000x, than a portfolio where all of them are 2x or 3x.\nIf a founding team hints, signals or even just appears likely to sell the company early, it\u2019s a strong negative indicator. Teams that are overly financially motivated often will sell a company for $100M or $200M. That\u2019s a life-changing outcome for them; but it doesn\u2019t matter much to you because you own so little. It\u2019s not going to move the needle on your net worth.\nAs Bill Gurley famously said, \u201cVenture capital is not even a home run business. It\u2019s a grand slam business.\u201d The smart VCs look for extreme outliers.\nThis is why smart VCs let founders sell secondaries early on. They take some money off the table in exchange for going for the gold.\nWhen you invest in a company that is going to sell early, you miss out on compounding interest. Also, VCs downstream will read that signal and pass on that deal, and the startup won\u2019t be able to raise the cash they need to become a big company.\nIt\u2019s difficult to pull this signal out of founders, although sometimes they offer it.\n\u2018First-Time Founders\u2019 Often Have Been Tinkering for Quite a While\nTheir \u2018first\u2019 startup isn\u2019t always their first startup\nNaval: There\u2019s a running debate among investors about which is best: first-time founders or repeat founders. There\u2019s no hard and fast answer.\nI\u2019d argue that most of the value in the industry is probably created by first-time founders. Think of Jeff Bezos, Bill Gates, Larry Page and Sergey Brin, and Mark Zuckerberg: Lightning strikes, things catch fire and the company takes off.\n\u2018First-time founder\u2019 can be misleading\nThough, the label \u201cfirst-time founder\u201d doesn\u2019t really apply to some of these. Zuckerberg had other projects before Facebook took off. Gates founded Traf-O-Data with Paul Allen long before they did Microsoft. They measured traffic and sold the data to cities.\nOften, a so-called \u201cfirst-time founder\u201d has been tinkering for quite a while.\nRepeat founders tend to be better at execution\nRepeat founders also can be extremely successful. Look at Uber, WhatsApp and Zoom.\nRepeat founders tend to be much better at execution. They\u2019re good at recruiting teams and generally more careful about what markets they enter. Repeat founders also have better connections, which makes fundraising easier.\nBecause repeat founders have been around, they\u2019re more likely to have established long-term relationships with people you know, making it easier to check their reputation and whether they have integrity.\nRepeat founders tend to be less passionate\nOn the other hand, repeat founders tend to be less passionate. They surveyed the market and picked what they think is going to work\u2014not necessarily what they\u2019re super excited about.\nThey tend to have less specific knowledge about the field because they haven\u2019t been buried in it for the last 20 years; although you sometimes get that specific knowledge with founders coming from bigger companies who incubated a technology they really like.\nDeals with repeat founders tend to be more expensive, so your returns are lower. There are tradeoffs. I don\u2019t have a hard and fast rule like \u201cdon\u2019t back repeat founders\u201d or \u201cdon\u2019t back first-time founders.\u201d I find both can work, and both can not work.\nRepeat Founders Don\u2019t Really Want to Start Over From Scratch\nTest repeat founders for passion\nNaval: With first-time founders, you must test their ability to learn. Are they fast learners? Will they learn how to run a company? Will they adapt and grow?\nThis is different than asking: \u201cAre they coachable?\u201d I believe coachability is overrated.\nTest repeat founders for passion\nWith repeat founders, you should test for passion. When the going gets tough, will they see the company all the way through\u2014or will they go start the next thing? Do they have conviction? Do they have the humility to go through it again, starting from scratch?\nRepeat founders often don\u2019t want to start over with four or five people crammed into a tiny space behind wooden desks. They want to start with a lot of money, a big bang, a big office and a big team.\nThat can work when there\u2019s mostly execution risk, which is often the case in enterprise sales and software. It doesn\u2019t work as well when there\u2019s invention risk, which is the case with consumer, social networks and deep technology development.\nFirst-time founders take on market risk\nNivi: So, first-time founders take on market risk, which explains why they tend to have the biggest outcomes. It also explains why most of them fail. While repeat founders take on execution risk, which explains why they deliver more consistent results. It also explains why the returns aren\u2019t huge: They\u2019re not betting on a market insight.\nNaval: That\u2019s a deep way of summarizing it. First-time founders take on market risk and create new markets as a result\u2014or own entire markets\u2014and repeat founders take on execution risk.\nThere are also some blends. For example, when you\u2019re developing a new technology, it can create a new market. That requires deep expertise, which favors a first-time founder. But it also requires raising lots of money and addressing things like manufacturability and distribution of something new, which might require a repeat founder\u2019s resources.\nSometimes a sweet spot emerges: a repeat founder with previous success that wasn\u2019t so big that they lost their first-time founder mentality.\nLet\u2019s say you have a team of people that builds robots. They failed because they were too early and the market wasn\u2019t quite ready. But they made a good attempt, and they did it with little money.\nThe team comes back later and still wants to build robots. They tell you the timing is finally right and they\u2019ve brought on a few younger people with access to new technology. Now they\u2019re in a position to raise more money\u2014and they\u2019ve got a big chip on their shoulder, determined to prove this space can work. Those kinds of bets can be very interesting.", "sentiment": 0.686, "pageUrl": "https://nav.al/angel-2", "date": "Thu, 11 Jun 2020 23:00:00 GMT", "person": "naval_ravikant"}, {"title": "Groups Search for Consensus, Individuals Search for Truth", "text": "Naval: What\u2019s considered to be true is fought over.

Our sources of stress are more chronic.\nLet\u2019s define stress. In physical terms, stress happens when something wants to be in two places at one time. If I apply pressure to both ends of an iron beam, I create stress on the beam because one part wants to be north and the other part wants to be south.\nStress is an inability to decide what\u2019s important\nIn mental terms, stress is an inability to decide what\u2019s important. You want two incompatible things at once. I want to relax, but I need to work. Now I\u2019m under stress.\nWhen you give up on something, it\u2019s no longer stressful.

The goal is peace.\nSo the question becomes: How do you get to peace?\nThe first problem with attaining peace is that no activity will get you there.

You\u2019re also not wishing you were doing something to change it, because that creates stress.\nYou cannot work toward peace, only understanding\nYou cannot achieve peace directly or even work toward it.

I don\u2019t want to have less desire or less work ethic.\u201d\nFact check on that is: True. The happier and more peaceful you are, the less likely you are to run out and change the world. At the same time, being unhappy is very inefficient. A peaceful person doesn\u2019t have extraneous thoughts going through their head. If you\u2019re a driven, unhappy person, your mind will be on 24/7.\nUnhappy people don\u2019t have good judgment\nWhat are the consequences of this? You won\u2019t sleep well. You\u2019re much more likely to react with anger and dig yourself into a hole you have to dig out of. Your decisions are emotional and impetuous. You\u2019re more likely to get caught in the busy trap\u2014busy all the time and running from one thing to another because you can\u2019t mentally prioritize.\nWhen you don\u2019t have peace of mind, it\u2019s difficult to make judgments because you have too many threads going through your head. You don\u2019t have time to devote to making those judgments.\nThere\u2019s a tradeoff. If you become the Buddha tomorrow, it\u2019s unlikely you\u2019ll also launch rockets to the moon like Elon Musk. On the other hand, there are plenty of successful, optimistic scientists, innovators and other leaders\u2014especially as they get older. Happy people aren\u2019t always ineffective.\nA peaceful mind makes better decisions\nWhen I got happier in my own life, I became much more effective\u2014even though I don\u2019t work as hard as I used to.

They think only dumb or lazy people can be happy. Entrepreneurs will say, \u201cI don\u2019t want to be happy because I want to be successful.\u201d They worry that if they get too happy they\u2019ll lose their desire and won\u2019t work hard anymore.\nCan you increase happiness without losing your drive?\nLike everything else, there is some truth to this. Generally, the more intelligent you are, the more you can see behind the fa\u00e7ade of everyday life being easy or safe. You see all the risks and downsides\u2014the calamities that await us. You see the cynicism and manipulation behind so many things portrayed as being good for you or society. You become cynical, and you signal your intelligence through cynicism. Very smart people often communicate in purely cynical observations.\nIt\u2019s OK to not want to be happy. But we\u2019re going to explore whether you can increase your happiness without significantly lowering your drive or intellect.\nLet\u2019s take the first objection: \u201cI\u2019m not happy because I\u2019m smart.\u201d This is partially true. You are unhappy partially because you know and understand too much. You\u2019ve been exposed to too much. But that doesn\u2019t mean that you can\u2019t be happy and retain your intelligence.\nFiguring out the truth will lead to happiness\nBut don\u2019t get it backwards: You\u2019re not smart because you\u2019re unhappy; you\u2019re unhappy because you\u2019re smart. You can be happy and smart\u2014it\u2019s just going to take more work. The good news is, smart people are good at figuring out the truth. The more you dig into certain deep truths, the freer and more peaceful you will become. That peace will lead to happiness.\nIf you\u2019re so smart, why aren\u2019t you happy? I absolutely believe that is true. The beauty of being mentally high functioning in our society is that you can trade it for almost anything. If you\u2019re smart, you can figure out how to be healthy within your genetic constraints and how to be wealthy within your environmental constraints.\nIf you\u2019re smart, you can figure out how to be happy within your biological constraints. But your biological constraints are a lot larger than you might think.\nThe dynamic range of happiness is quite large\nIf you\u2019ve ever gotten drunk or achieved an altered state of mind on psychedelic drugs or through meditation, breathing or other hypnotic techniques, you have experienced brief moments of happiness beyond what you feel on a typical day.\nOf course, some of this is a fake, pleasure-driven happiness. But there\u2019s truth to it; otherwise, you wouldn\u2019t desire that state.\nAchieving these brief states of happiness can show you how dynamic your range is\u2014and that range can be quite large.\nHow do you nudge yourself in that direction on a perpetual basis, as opposed to visiting it by stunning your mind into submission and silence?\nRelated", "sentiment": -0.698, "pageUrl": "https://nav.al/smart", "date": "Tue, 11 Feb 2020 23:00:00 GMT", "person": "naval_ravikant"}, {"title": "Desire Is a Contract You Make to Be Unhappy", "text": "Naval: Desire\u2019s a contract you make to be unhappy until you get what you want.

Finally, when you get it, you revert to the state you were in before you had it. It\u2019s not like you achieve some peak level of bliss that you stay on forever.\nNo single thing will make you happy forever\nPeople hold onto a delusion that there\u2019s something out there that will make them happy and fulfilled forever. No single thing can do that.\nEnlightenment is something different. It seems to be a permanent solution; but we\u2019re not going to explore that just yet.

Rather, achieving happiness requires a process of understanding and self-discovery. It is a process of training yourself to see certain truths.\nIf obtaining things made us permanently happy, then the cavemen would have been miserable, and we would all be deliriously happy.

This is where a lot of people get tripped up. For the vast majority of people, some of their happiness\u2014probably a lot more than they think\u2014is in their control.\nThis step is not easy. You might be stuck on this for a long time. Many people believe that happiness cannot be developed or changed, so they devalue it. They say, \u201cWell, I don\u2019t want to be happy.\u201d\nGenetics is important, but it\u2019s only half the picture\nGenetics is important. It goes a long way in determining strength, athletic performance and intelligence. But your genetic set point is only about half of it. And happiness, or general contentment, is much more malleable than the other things.\nIt would be very hard for me to change my athletic performance dramatically purely by working out. I\u2019m much more limited in that arena because of my genetics. But things like my temperament, outlook on life, how peaceful I am, how angry I get\u2014these are much more in my control.\nYou\u2019re not stuck at your level of happiness\nSo, happiness is a skill like nutrition and fitness. Happiness is a skill you identify and develop that slowly gives you results as you get better at it. It is not God-given.

Most of us recognize you\u2019re not going to buy your way to happiness. But in modern times, you can buy your way out of common causes of unhappiness. Financial wealth can give you freedom and more time. It can give you peace.\nRenouncing things is not an easy path to happiness\nIn olden times, one of the routes to finding peace was becoming a monk. You would renounce things\u2014sex, shelter, money and other material attachments\u2014and go off in the woods. You might find some peace after 30 years, when you\u2019d finally gotten over the fact that you weren\u2019t going to have these things. The truth is, most of them probably never got over it. There are lots of monks out there but there aren\u2019t a lot of enlightened people.\nIt\u2019s easier to fulfill your material needs than to renounce them\nIt was Osho who said, essentially: \u201cEvery time I meet a prostitute, she wants to talk about God. And every time I meet a priest, he wants to talk about sex.\u201d Whatever you deny yourself will become your new prison.\nToday it\u2019s actually easier to fulfill your desire for material comfort than it is to renounce it. It\u2019ll take you a lifetime to renounce material comfort, and it still might not work. But you can make be materially successful in less than a lifetime.\nYou can achieve happiness without material comfort, and it probably would be a more lasting form of happiness. But that\u2019s playing on hard mode.\nWhen you\u2019re sick, your desires run away\nPhysical health is the foundation of everything. If you don\u2019t have your physical health, you have nothing. A Confucius saying I like: \u201cA sick man only wants one thing, a healthy man wants 10,000 things.\u201d When you\u2019re sick, your desires run away. Without the ability to get up and function, you can\u2019t turn into the desiring machine that you are.\nAlthough physical health is the most important, I speak the least about it because it\u2019s the area where I have the least specific knowledge. I am not self-actualized in that regard. I\u2019m in OK shape and have an OK diet. I understand the theories of physical health, but I would feel fraudulent offering it to you unless I were a paragon of physical health myself.\nI\u2019ve gone from being unhappy to being very happy\nIn wealth, I\u2019m much more self-actualized. And on the mental health side\u2014finding happiness and peace\u2014I\u2019ve gone from being a mostly unhappy person to being very happy. That was deliberate. It was practiced and effort-based.

It\u2019s really a discussion of highly practical philosophy.\nPhilosophy, as we normally think of it, is impractical. It\u2019s abstract and obtuse\u2014something written a long time ago in fancy language. We put it on a pedestal and it feels unapproachable. Sometimes it comes across like truisms.\nThe big problems are the old ones\nBut if you live long enough, you will become a philosopher yourself.

Let\u2019s get to a state of financial health where we\u2019re not fearful day to day. That\u2019s where we started, and we spent a lot of time on that.

I have a job.\u201d\nYou have to rent your time to get started\nIn one of the tweets from the cutting room floor, you wrote: \u201cYou will need to rent your time to get started. This is only acceptable when you are learning and saving. Preferably in a business where society does not yet know how to train people and apprenticeship is the only model.\u201d\nNaval: Try to learn something that people haven\u2019t quite figured out how to teach yet. That can happen if you\u2019re working in a new and quickly expanding field. It\u2019s also common in fields that are circumstantial\u2014where the details matter and it\u2019s always moving. Investing is one of those fields; so is entrepreneurship.\nChief of Staff for a founder is one of the most coveted jobs for young people starting out in Silicon Valley. The brightest kids will follow an entrepreneur around and do whatever he or she needs them to do.\nIn many cases, the person is way overqualified. Someone with multiple graduate degrees might be running the CEO\u2019s laundry because that\u2019s the most important thing at the moment.\nAt the same time, that person gets to attend the most important meetings. They are privy to all the stress and theatrics, the fundraising decks and the innovation\u2014knowledge that can only come from being in the room.\nComing out of college, Warren Buffett wanted to work for Benjamin Graham to learn to be a value investor. Buffett offered to work for free, and Graham responded, \u201cYou\u2019re overpriced.\u201d What that means is you have to make sacrifices to take on an apprenticeship.\nFind the part of the job with the steepest learning curve\nIf you can\u2019t learn in an apprenticeship model because you need to make money, try to be innovative in the context of your job. Take on new challenges and responsibilities. Find the part of the job with the steepest learning curve.\nYou want to avoid repetitive drudgery\u2014that\u2019s just biding time until your job is automated away.\nIf you\u2019re a barista at the coffee shop, figure out how to make connections with the customers. Figure out how to innovate the service you offer and delight the customer. Managers, founders and owners will take notice.\nDevelop a founder mentality\nThe hardest thing for any founder is finding employees with a founder mentality. This is a fancy way of saying they care enough.\nPeople will say, \u201cWell, I\u2019m not the founder. I\u2019m not being paid enough to care.\u201d Actually, you are: The knowledge and skills you gain by developing a founder mentality set you up to be a founder down the line; that\u2019s your compensation.\nYou can get a lot out of almost any position. You just have to put a lot into it.\nAccountability is something you can take on immediately\nNivi: We\u2019ve discussed accountability, judgment, specific knowledge and leverage. If I\u2019m working a \u201cnormal\u201d job, is specific knowledge the one I should focus on?\nNaval: Judgment takes experience. It takes a lot of time to build up. You have to put yourself in positions where you can exercise judgment. That\u2019ll come from taking on accountability.\nLeverage is something that society gives you after you\u2019ve demonstrated judgment. You can get it faster by learning high-leverage skills like coding or working with the media. These are permissionless leverage. This is why I encourage people to learn to code or produce media, even if it\u2019s just nights and weekends.\nSo, judgment and leverage tend to come later. Accountability is something you can take on immediately. You can say, \u201cHey, I\u2019ll take charge of this thing that nobody wants to take charge of.\u201d When you take on accountability, you\u2019re also publicly putting your neck on the chopping block\u2014so you have to deliver.\nYou build specific knowledge by taking accountability for things that other people don\u2019t know how to do. Perhaps they\u2019re things you enjoy doing or are naturally inclined towards doing anyway.\nIf you work in a factory, the hardest thing may be raising capital to keep the factory running. Maybe that\u2019s what the owner is always stressed out about.\nYou might notice this and think, \u201cI\u2019m good at balancing my checkbook and have a good head for numbers; but I haven\u2019t raised money before.\u201d You offer to help and become the owner\u2019s sidekick solving their fundraising problem. If you have a natural aptitude and take on accountability, you can put yourself in a position to learn quickly. Before long, you\u2019ll become the heir apparent.\nEarly on, find things that interest you and allow you to take on accountability. Don\u2019t worry about short-term compensation. Compensation comes when you\u2019re tired of waiting for it and have given up on it. This is the way the whole system works.\nIf you take on accountability and solve problems on the edge of knowledge that others can\u2019t solve, people will line up behind you. The leverage will come.\nSpecific knowledge can be timely or timeless\nThere are two forms of specific knowledge: timely and timeless.\nIf you become a world-class expert in machine learning just as it takes off and you got there through genuine intellectual interest, you\u2019re going to do really well. But 20 years from now, machine learning may be second hat; the world may have moved on to something else. That\u2019s timely knowledge.\nIf you\u2019re good at persuading people, it\u2019s probably a skill you picked up early on in life. It\u2019s always going to apply, because persuading people is always going to be valuable. That\u2019s timeless knowledge.\nNow, persuasion is a generic skill\u2014it\u2019s probably not enough to build a career on. You need to combine it in a skill stack, as Scott Adams writes. You might combine persuasion with accounting and an understanding of semiconductor production lines. Now you can become the best semiconductor salesperson and, later on, the best semiconductor company CEO.\nTimeless specific knowledge usually can\u2019t be taught, and it sticks with you forever. Timely specific knowledge comes and goes; but it tends to have a fairly long shelf life.\nTechnology is a good place to find those timely skills sets. If you can bring in a more generic specialized knowledge skill set from the outside, then you\u2019ve got gold.\nTechnology is an intellectual frontier for gaining specific knowledge\nNivi: There were a couple other tweets from the cutting-room floor on this topic. The first: \u201cThe technology industry is a great place to acquire specific knowledge. The frontier is always moving forward. If you are genuinely intellectually curious, you will acquire the knowledge ahead of others.\u201d\nNaval: Danny Hillis famously said technology is everything that doesn\u2019t work yet. Technology is around us everywhere. The spoon was technology once; fire was technology once. When we figured out how to make them work, they disappeared in the background and became part of our everyday lives.\nTechnology is, by definition, the intellectual frontier. It\u2019s taking things from science and culture that we have not figured out how to mass produce or create efficiently and figuring out how to commercialize it and make it available to everybody.\nTechnology will always be a great field where you can pick up specific knowledge that is valuable to society.\nIf you don\u2019t have accountability, do something different\nNivi: Here\u2019s another tweet from the cutting-room floor related to accountability: \u201cCompanies don\u2019t know how to measure outputs, so they measure inputs instead. Work in a way that your outputs are visible and measurable. If you don\u2019t have accountability, do something different.\u201d\nNaval: The entire structure of rewarding people comes from the agricultural and industrial ages, when inputs and outputs matched up closely. The amount of hours you put into doing something was a reliable proxy for what kind of output you\u2019d get.\nToday, it\u2019s extremely nonlinear. One good investment decision can make a company $10 million or $100 million. One good product feature can be the difference between product-market fit and complete failure.\nAs a result, judgment and accountability matter much more. Often the best engineers aren\u2019t the hardest workers. Sometimes they don\u2019t work very hard at all, but they dependably ship that one critical product at just the right time. It\u2019s similar to the salesperson who closes the huge deal that makes the company\u2019s numbers for the quarter.\nPeople need to be able to tell what role you had in the company\u2019s success. That doesn\u2019t mean stomping all over your team\u2014people are extremely sensitive to others taking too much credit. You always want to be giving out credit. Smart people will know who was responsible.\nSome jobs are too removed from the customer for this type of accountability. You\u2019re just a cog in a machine.\nConsulting is a good example. As a consultant, your ideas are delivered through someone else within the organization. You may not have visibility to the top people; you may be hidden behind a screen. That\u2019s a trade-off you\u2019re making in exchange for your independence.\nYou\u2019ll develop thick-skin if you take on accountability\nWhen you have accountability, you get a lot more credit when things go right. Of course, the downside is you get hurt a lot more when things go wrong. When you stick your neck out, you have to be willing to be blamed, sacrificed and even attacked.\nIf you\u2019re the kind of person who thrives in a high-accountability environment, you\u2019re going to end up thick-skinned over time. You\u2019re going to get hurt a lot. People are going to attack you if you fail.\nScale your specific knowledge with apprentices\nNivi: Once you get some specific knowledge, you can scale it by training your own apprentices and outsourcing tasks to them.\nNaval: For example, I made good investments and figured out the venture business. I could have kept doing that and making money. Instead, I co-founded Spearhead to train up-and-coming founders to become angels and venture investors. We give them a checkbook to start investing.\nIt\u2019s an apprenticeship model. They come to us with deals they\u2019re looking at, and we help them think it through. This model is more scalable than my personal investing.\nSpecific knowledge comes on the job, not in a classroom\nAt Spearhead we lead classes teaching founders about investing, and we also hold office hours to discuss specific deals they bring.\nIt turns out the classes and talks we lead are largely worthless. You can give all the generic advice people need in about an hour. After that, the advice gets so circumstantial that it essentially cancels to zero. But the office hours are incredibly useful.\nThis reinforces the notion that investing is one of those skills that can only be learned on the job. When you find a skill like that, you\u2019re dealing with specific knowledge.\nAnother good indicator of specific knowledge is when someone can\u2019t give a straight answer to the question: \u201cWhat do you do every day?\u201d Or you get an answer along the lines of, \u201cEvery day is different based on what\u2019s going on.\u201d\nThe thing is so complicated and dependent upon circumstances that it can\u2019t be boiled down into a textbook form.\nNivi: The mafia figured out this apprenticeship model a long time ago. The best way to end up running one of the families was to become the driver for the Don.\nNaval: Tony Soprano was a businessman who had to enforce his own contracts.

Everyone vaguely knows they want to be wealthy, but they don\u2019t have a good set of principles to do it by.\nWealth is assets that earn while you sleep\nNivi: What\u2019s the difference between wealth, money and status?\nNaval: Wealth is the thing you want. Wealth is assets that earn while you sleep; it\u2019s the factory of robots cranking out things. Wealth is the computer program running at night that\u2019s serving other customers. Wealth is money in the bank that is reinvested into other assets and businesses.\nA house can be a form of wealth, because you can rent it out; although that\u2019s a less productive use of land than running a commercial enterprise.\nMy definition of wealth is oriented toward businesses and assets that can earn while you sleep.\nWealth buys your freedom\nYou want wealth because it buys you freedom\u2014so you don\u2019t have to wear a tie like a collar around your neck; so you don\u2019t have to wake up at 7:00 a.m. to rush to work and sit in commute traffic; so you don\u2019t have to waste your life grinding productive hours away into a soulless job that doesn\u2019t fulfill you.\nThe purpose of wealth is freedom; it\u2019s nothing more than that. It\u2019s not to buy fur coats, or to drive Ferraris, or to sail yachts, or to jet around the world in a Gulf Stream. That stuff gets really boring and stupid, really fast. It\u2019s about being your own sovereign individual.\nYou\u2019re not going to get that unless you really want it. The entire world wants it, and the entire world is working hard at it.\nIt is competitive to some extent. It\u2019s a positive sum game\u2014but there are competitive elements to it, because there\u2019s a finite amount of resources right now in society. To get the resources to do what you want, you have to stand out.\nMoney is how we transfer wealth\nMoney is how we transfer wealth. Money is social credits; it\u2019s the ability to have credits and debits of other people\u2019s time.\nIf I do my job right and create value for society, society says, \u201cOh, thank you. We owe you something in the future for the work that you did. Here\u2019s a little IOU. Let\u2019s call that money.\u201d\nThat money gets debased because people steal the IOUs; the government prints extra IOUs; and people renege on their IOUs. But money tries to be a reliable IOU from society that you are owed something for something you did in the past.\nWe transfer these IOUs around; money is how we transfer wealth.\nStatus is your rank in the social hierarchy\nThere are fundamentally two huge games in life that people play. One is the money game. Money is not going to solve all of your problems; but it\u2019s going to solve all of your money problems. I think people know that. They realize that, so they want to make money.\nAt the same time, deep down many people believe they can\u2019t make it; so they don\u2019t want any wealth creation to happen. They virtue signal by attacking the whole enterprise, saying, \u201cWell, making money is evil. You shouldn\u2019t do it.\u201d\nBut they\u2019re actually playing the other game, which is the status game. They\u2019re trying to be high status in the eyes of others by saying, \u201cWell, I don\u2019t need money. We don\u2019t want money.\u201d\nStatus is your ranking in the social hierarchy.\nWealth is not a zero-sum game. Everybody in the world can have a house. Because you have a house doesn\u2019t take away from my ability to have a house. If anything, the more houses that are built, the easier it becomes to build houses, the more we know about building houses, and the more people can have houses.\nWealth is a very positive-sum game. We create things together. We\u2019re starting this endeavor to create a piece of art that explains what we\u2019re doing. At the end of it, something brand new will be created. It\u2019s a positive-sum game.\nStatus is a very old game\nStatus, on the other hand, is a zero-sum game. It\u2019s a very old game. We\u2019ve been playing it since monkey tribes. It\u2019s hierarchical. Who\u2019s number one? Who\u2019s number two? Who\u2019s number three? And for number three to move to number two, number two has to move out of that slot. So, status is a zero-sum game.\nPolitics is an example of a status game. Even sports is an example of a status game. To be the winner, there must be a loser. Fundamentally, I don\u2019t like status games. They play an important role in our society, so we can figure out who\u2019s in charge. But you play them because they\u2019re a necessary evil.\nOn an evolutionary basis\u2014if you go back thousands of years\u2014status is a much better predictor of survival than wealth. You couldn\u2019t have wealth before the farming age because you couldn\u2019t store things. Hunter-gatherers carried everything on their backs.\nHunter-gatherers lived in entirely status-based societies. Farmers started going to wealth-based societies. The modern industrial economies are much more heavily wealth-based societies.\nPeople creating wealth will always be attacked by people playing status games\nThere\u2019s always a subtle competition going on between status and wealth. For example, when journalists attack rich people or the tech industry, they\u2019re really bidding for status. They\u2019re saying, \u201cNo, the people are more important. And I, the journalist, represent the people, and therefore I am more important.\u201d\nThe problem is, to win at a status game you have to put somebody else down. That\u2019s why you should avoid status games in your life\u2014because they make you into an angry combative person. You\u2019re always fighting to put other people down and elevate yourself and the people you like.\nStatus games are always going to exist; there\u2019s no way around it. Realize that most of the time when you\u2019re trying to create wealth, you\u2019re getting attacked by someone else and they\u2019re trying to look like a goody-two shoes. They\u2019re trying to up their own status at your expense.\nThey\u2019re playing a different game. And it\u2019s a worse game. It\u2019s a zero-sum game, instead of a positive-sum game.\nMake Abundance for the World\nWealth isn\u2019t about taking something from somebody else\nEthical wealth creation makes abundance for the world\nNaval: I think there is this notion that making money is evil, right? It\u2019s rooted all the way back down to \u201cmoney is the root of all evil.\u201d People think that the bankers steal our money. It\u2019s somewhat true in that, in a lot of the world, there\u2019s a lot of theft going on all the time.\nThe history of the world, in some sense, is this predator/prey relationship between makers and takers. There are people who go out and create things, and build things, and work hard on things.\nThen there are people who come along with a sword, or a gun, or taxes, or crony capitalism, or Communism, or what have you. There\u2019s all these different methods to steal.\nEven in nature, there are more parasites than there are non-parasitical organisms. You have a ton of parasites in you, who are living off of you. The better ones are symbiotic, they\u2019re giving something back. But there are a lot that are just taking. That\u2019s the nature of how any complex system is built.\nWhat I am focused on is true wealth creation. It\u2019s not about taking money. It\u2019s not about taking something from somebody else. It\u2019s from creating abundance.\nObviously, there isn\u2019t a finite number of jobs, or finite amount of wealth. Otherwise we would still be sitting around in caves, figuring out how to divide up pieces of fire wood, and the occasional dead deer.\nMost of the wealth in civilization, in fact all of it, has been created. It got created from somewhere. It got created from people. It got created from technology. It got created from productivity. It got created from hard work. This idea that it\u2019s stolen is this horrible zero-sum game that people who are trying to gain status play.\nEveryone can be rich\nBut the reality is everyone can be rich. We can see that by seeing, that in the First World, everyone is basically richer than almost anyone who was alive 200 years ago.\n200 years ago nobody had antibiotics. Nobody had cars. Nobody had electricity. Nobody had the iPhone. All of these things are inventions that have made us wealthier as a species.\nToday, I would rather be a poor person in a First World country, than be a rich person in Louis the XIV\u2019s France. I\u2019d rather be a poor person today than aristocrat back then. That\u2019s because of wealth creation.\nThe engine of technology is science that is applied for the purpose of creating abundance. So, I think fundamentally everybody can be wealthy.\nThis thought experiment I want you to think through is imagine if everybody had the knowledge of a good software engineer and a good hardware engineer. If you could go out there, and you could build robots, and computers, and bridges, and program them. Let\u2019s say every human knew how to do that.\nWhat do you think society would look like in 20 years? My guess is what would happen is we would build robots, machines, software and hardware to do everything. We would all be living in massive abundance.\nWe would essentially be retired, in the sense that none of us would have to work for any of the basics. We\u2019d even have robotic nurses. We\u2019d have machine driven hospitals. We\u2019d have self-driving cars. We\u2019d have farms that are 100% automated. We\u2019d have clean energy.\nAt that point, we could use technology breakthroughs to get everything that we wanted. If anyone is still working at that point, they\u2019re working as a form of expressing their creativity. They\u2019re working because it\u2019s in them to contribute, and to build and design things.\nI don\u2019t think capitalism is evil. Capitalism is actually good. It\u2019s just that it gets hijacked. It gets hijacked by improper pricing of externalities. It gets hijacked by improper yields, where you have corruption, or you have monopolies.\nFree Markets Are Intrinsic to Humans\nWe use credits and debits to cooperate across genetic boundaries\nFree markets are intrinsic to the human species\nNaval: Overall capitalism [meaning free markets] is intrinsic to the human species. Capitalism is not something we invented. Capitalism is not even something we discovered. It is in us in every exchange that we have.\nWhen you and I exchange information, I want some information back from you. I give you information. You give me information. If we weren\u2019t having a good information exchange, you\u2019d go talk to somebody else. So, the notion of exchange, and keeping track of credits and debits, this is built into us as flexible social animals.\nWe are the only animals in the animal kingdom that cooperate across genetic boundaries. Most animals don\u2019t even cooperate. But when they do, they cooperate only in packs where they co-evolve together, and they share blood, so they have some shared interests.\nHumans don\u2019t have that. I can cooperate with you guys. One of you is a Serbian. The other one is a Persian by origin. And I\u2019m Indian by origin. We have very little blood in common, basically none. But we still cooperate.\nWhat lets us cooperate? It\u2019s because we can keep track of debits and credits. Who put in how much work? Who contributed how much? That\u2019s all free market capitalism is.\nSo, I strongly believe that it is innate to the human species, and we are going to create more and more wealth, and abundance for everybody.\nEverybody can be wealthy. Everybody can be retired. Everybody can be successful. It is merely a question of education and desire. You have to want it. If you don\u2019t want it, that\u2019s fine. Then you opt out of the game.\nBut don\u2019t try to put down the people who are playing the game. Because that\u2019s the game that keeps you in a comfortable warm bed at night. That\u2019s the game that keeps a roof over your head. That\u2019s the game that keeps your supermarkets stocked. That\u2019s the game that keeps the iPhone buzzing in your pocket.\nSo, it is a beautiful game that is worth playing ethically, rationally, morally, socially for the human race. It\u2019s going to continue to make us all richer and richer, until we have massive wealth creation for anybody who wants it.\nToo many takers and not enough makers will plunge a society into ruin\nNivi: It\u2019s not just individuals secretly despising wealth, right? There are countries, groups, political parties that overtly despise wealth. Or at least seem to.\nNaval: That\u2019s right. What those countries, political parties, and groups are reduced to is playing the zero-sum game of status. In the process to destroy wealth creation, they drag everybody down to their level.\nWhich is why the U.S. is a very popular country for immigrants because of the American dream. Anyone can come here, be poor, and then work really hard and make money, and get wealthy. But even just make some basic money for their life.\nObviously, the definition of wealth is different for different people. A First World citizen\u2019s definition of wealth might be, \u201cOh, I have to make millions of dollars, and I\u2019m completely done.\u201d\nWhereas to a Third World poor immigrant just entering the country, and we were poor immigrants who came here when I as fairly young, to the United States, wealth may just be a much lower number. It may just be, \u201cI don\u2019t have to work a manual labor job for the rest of my life that I don\u2019t want to work.\u201d\nBut groups that despise it will essentially bring the entire group to that level. If you get too many takers, and not enough makers, society falls apart. You end up with a communist country.\nLook at Venezuela, right? They were so busy taking, and dividing, and reallocating, that people are literally starving in the streets, and losing kilograms of body weight every year just from sheer starvation.\nAnother way to think about it is imagine an organism that has too many parasites. You need some small number of parasites to stay healthy.\nYou need a lot of symbiotes. All the mitochondria in all of our cells that help us respirate and burn oxygen. These are symbiotes that help us survive. We couldn\u2019t survive without them.\nBut, to me, those are partners in the wealth creation that creates the human body. But if you just were filled with parasites, if you got infected with worms, or a virus, or bacteria that were purely parasitical, you would die. So, any organism can only withstand a small number of parasites. When the parasitic element gets too far out of control, you die.\nAgain I\u2019m talking about ethical wealth creation. I\u2019m not talking about monopolies. I\u2019m not talking about crony capitalism. I\u2019m not talking about mispriced externalities like the environment.\nI\u2019m talking about free minds, and free markets. Small-scale exchange between humans that\u2019s voluntary, and doesn\u2019t have an outsized impact on others.\nI think that kind of wealth creation, if a society does not respect it, if the group does not respect it, then society will plunge into ruin, and darkness.\nMaking Money Isn\u2019t About Luck\nBecome the kind of person who makes money\nMaking money isn\u2019t about luck\nNaval: Obviously, we want to be wealthy, and we want to get there in this lifetime without having to rely on luck.\nA lot of people think making money is about luck. It\u2019s not. It\u2019s about becoming the kind of person that makes money.\nI like to think that if I lost all my money and if you drop me on a random street in any English-speaking country, within 5, 10 years I\u2019d be wealthy again. Because it\u2019s a skill set that I\u2019ve developed and I think anyone can develop.\nIn 1,000 parallel universes, you want to be wealthy in 999 of them. You don\u2019t want to be wealthy in the 50 of them where you got lucky. We want to factor luck out of it.\nThere\u2019s four kinds of luck that we\u2019re talking about. This came from a book. Marc Andreessen, wrote a blog post about it.\n1. Blind luck\nThe first kind of luck you might say is blind luck. Where I just got lucky because something completely out of my control happened. That\u2019s fortune, that\u2019s fate.\n2. Luck from hustling\nThen there\u2019s luck that comes through persistence, hard work, hustle, motion. Which is when you\u2019re running around creating lots of opportunities, you\u2019re generating a lot of energy, you\u2019re doing a lot of things, lots of things will get stirred up in the dust.\nIt\u2019s almost like mixing a petri dish and seeing what combines. Or mixing a bunch of reagents and seeing what combines. You\u2019re generating enough force and hustle and energy that luck will find you.\nWe, as a group, you could argue, got together because of that. Nenad had put up these great videos online, I saw them on Twitter. In that sense, he generated his own luck by creating videos until people like me keep finding him.\n3. Luck from preparation\nA third way is that you become very good at spotting luck. If you are very skilled in a field, you will notice when a lucky break happens in that field. When other people who aren\u2019t attuned to it won\u2019t notice. So you become sensitive to luck and that\u2019s through skill and knowledge and work.\n4. Luck from your unique character\nThen the last kind of luck is the weirdest, hardest kind. But that\u2019s what we want to talk about. Which is where you build a unique character, a unique brand, a unique mindset, where then luck finds you.\nFor example, let\u2019s say that you\u2019re the best person in the world at deep sea underwater diving. You\u2019re known to take on deep sea underwater dives that nobody else will even attempt to dare.\nThen, by sheer luck, somebody finds a sunken treasure ship off the coast. They can\u2019t get it. Well, their luck just became your luck, because they\u2019re going to come to you to get that treasure. You\u2019re going to get paid for it.\nNow, that\u2019s an extreme example. The person who got lucky by finding the treasure chest, that was blind luck. But them coming to you and asking you to extract it and having to give you half, that\u2019s not luck.\nYou created your own luck. You put yourself in a position to be able to capitalize on that luck. Or to attract that luck when nobody else has created that opportunity for themselves. When we talk about \u201cwithout getting lucky,\u201d we want to be deterministic, we don\u2019t want to leave it to chance.\nIn 1,000 parallel universes, you want to be wealthy in 999 of them\nNivi: Do you want to elaborate a little bit more on the idea that in a 1,000 parallel universes you want to get rich in 999 of them? I think some people are going to see that and say, \u201cthat sounds impossible, it sounds like it\u2019s too good to be true.\u201d\nNaval: No, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s impossible. I think that you may have to work a little bit harder at it given your starting circumstances. I started as a poor kid in India, so if I can make it, anybody can, in that sense.\nNow, obviously, I had all my limbs and I had my mental faculties and I did have an education. There are some prerequisites you can\u2019t get past. But if you\u2019re listening to this video or podcast, you probably have the requisite means at your disposal, which is a functioning body and a functioning mind.\nAnd I\u2019ve encountered plenty of bad luck along the way. The first little fortune that I made, I instantly lost in the stock market. The second little fortune that I made, or I should have made, I basically got cheated by my business partners. It\u2019s only the third time around has been a charm.\nAnd, even then, it has been in a slow and steady struggle. I haven\u2019t made money in my life in one giant payout. It\u2019s always been a whole bunch of small things piling up. It\u2019s more about consistently creating wealth by creating businesses, including opportunities and creating investments. It hasn\u2019t been a giant one-off thing.\nWealth stacks up one chip at a time, not all at once\nMy personal wealth has not been generated by one big year. It stacks up little bit, chips at a time. More options, more businesses, more investments, more things that I can do.\nSame way that someone like Nenad, illacertus, he\u2019s building his brand online. He\u2019s building videos. It\u2019s not like any one video is going to suddenly shower him with riches overnight. It\u2019s going to be a long lifetime of learning, of reading, of creating that\u2019s going to compound.\nWe\u2019re talking about getting wealthy so you can retire, so you have your freedom. Not retire in the sense that you don\u2019t do anything. But in the sense that you don\u2019t have to be any place you don\u2019t want to be, you don\u2019t have to do anything you don\u2019t want to do, you can wake up when you want, you can sleep when you want, you don\u2019t have a boss. That\u2019s freedom.\nWe\u2019re talking about enough wealth to get to freedom. Especially thanks to the Internet these days, though, opportunities are massively abundant. I, in fact, have too many ways to make money, I don\u2019t have enough time. I have opportunities pouring out of my ears and the thing I keep running out of is time.\nThere\u2019s just so many ways to create wealth, to create products, to create businesses, to create opportunities, and to, as a byproduct, get paid by society that I can\u2019t even handle it all.\nMake Luck Your Destiny\nBuild your character in a way that luck becomes deterministic\nNivi: I think it\u2019s pretty interesting that the first three kinds of luck that you described there are very common cliches for them that everybody knows. And then for that last kind of luck that comes to you out of the unique way that you act, there\u2019s no real cliche for it.\nSo, for the first three kinds, there\u2019s \u201cdumb luck,\u201d or \u201cblind luck.\u201d That\u2019s the first kind of luck. The second kind of luck there\u2019s the clich\u00e9 that \u201cfortune favors the bold.\u201d That\u2019s a person who gets lucky just by stirring the pot and acting. The third kind of luck, people say that \u201cchance favors the prepared mind.\u201d\nBut for the fourth kind of luck, there isn\u2019t a common clich\u00e9 out there that matches the unique character of your action, which I think is interesting and perhaps an opportunity and it also shows that people aren\u2019t necessarily taking advantage of that kind of luck the way they should be.\nNaval: I think also at that point, it starts becoming so deterministic that it stops being luck. So, the definition starts fading from luck to more destiny. So, I would characterize that fourth one as you build your character in a certain way and then your character becomes your destiny.\nBuild your character so opportunity finds you\nOne of the things I think that is important to making money, when you want the kind of reputation that makes people do deals through you. I use the example of like, if you\u2019re a great diver then treasure hunters will come and give you a piece of the treasure for your diving skills.\nIf you\u2019re a trusted, reliable, high-integrity, long-term thinking deal maker, then when other people want to do deals but they don\u2019t know how to do them in a trustworthy manner with strangers, they will literally approach you and give you a cut of the deal or offer you a unique deal just because of the integrity and reputation that you have built up.\nWarren Buffett, he gets offered deals, and he gets to buy companies, and he gets to buy warrants, and bailout banks and do things that other people can\u2019t do because of his reputation.\nBut of course that\u2019s fragile. It has accountability on the line, it has a strong brand on the line, and as we will talk about later, that comes with accountability attached.\nBut I would say your character, your reputation, these are things that you can build that then will let you take up advantage of opportunities that other people may characterize as lucky but you know that it wasn\u2019t luck.\nNivi: You said that this fourth kind of luck is more or less a destiny. There\u2019s a quote from that original book that was in Marc\u2019s blog posts from Benjamin Disraeli, who I think was the former prime minister of the UK. The quote to describe this kind of luck was, \u201cwe make our fortunes and we call them fate.\u201d\nYou have to be a little eccentric to be out on the frontier by yourself\nThere were a couple other interesting things about this kind of luck that were mentioned in the blog post, I think it\u2019ll be good for the listeners to hear about is that, this fourth kind of luck can almost come out of eccentric ways that you do your things and that eccentricity is not necessarily a bad thing in this case. In fact, it\u2019s a good thing.\nNaval: Yeah, absolutely. Because the world is a very efficient place, so, everyone has dug through all the obvious places to dig and so to find something that\u2019s new and novel and uncovered, it helps to be operating on a frontier.\nWhere right there you have to be a little eccentric to be out on the frontier by yourself, and then you have to be willing to dig deeper than other people do, deeper than seems rational just because you\u2019re interested.\nNivi: Yeah, the two quotes that I\u2019ve seen that express this kind of luck in addition to that Benjamin Disraeli one, are this one from Sam Altman where he said, \u201cextreme people get extreme results.\u201d I think that\u2019s pretty nice. And then there\u2019s this other one from Jeffrey Pfeffer, who is a professor at Stanford that, \u201cyou can\u2019t be normal and expect abnormal returns.\u201d I\u2019ve always enjoyed that one too.\nNaval: Yeah. And one quote that I like which is the exact opposite of that is, \u201cplay stupid games win stupid prizes.\u201d A lot of people spend a lot of their time playing social games like on Twitter where you\u2019re trying to improve your social standing and you basically win stupid social prizes which are worthless.\nNivi: I guess the last thing that I have from this blog post is the idea that by pursuing these kinds of luck especially the last one, basically everything but dumb luck, by pursuing them you essentially run out of unluck. So, if you just keep stirring the pot and stirring the pot, that alone you will run out of unluck.\nNaval: Yeah, or it could just be reversion to the mean. So, then you at least neutralized luck so that it\u2019s your own talents that come into play.\nYou Won\u2019t Get Rich Renting Out Your Time\nYou can\u2019t earn non-linearly when you\u2019re renting out your time\nYou won\u2019t get rich renting out your time\nNivi: Next you go into more specific details on how you can actually get rich, and how you can\u2019t get rich. The first point was about how you\u2019re not going to get rich: \u201cYou are not going to get rich renting out your time. You must own equity, a piece of the business to gain your financial freedom.\u201d\nNaval: This is probably one of the absolute most important points. People seem to think that you can create wealth, and make money through work. And it\u2019s probably not going to work. There are many reasons for that.\nBut the most basic is just that your inputs are very closely tied to your outputs. In almost any salaried job, even at one that\u2019s paying a lot per hour like a lawyer, or a doctor, you\u2019re still putting in the hours, and every hour you get paid.\nSo, what that means is when you\u2019re sleeping, you\u2019re not earning. When you\u2019re retired, you\u2019re not earning. When you\u2019re on vacation, you\u2019re not earning. And you can\u2019t earn non-linearly.\nIf you look at even doctors who get rich, like really rich, it\u2019s because they open a business. They open like a private practice. And that private practice builds a brand, and that brand attracts people. Or they build some kind of a medical device, or a procedure, or a process with an intellectual property.\nSo, essentially you\u2019re working for somebody else, and that person is taking on the risk, and has the accountability, and the intellectual property, and the brand. So, they\u2019re just not gonna pay you enough. They\u2019re gonna pay you the bare minimum that they have to, to get you to do their job. And that can be a high bare minimum, but it\u2019s still not gonna be true wealth where you\u2019re retired.\nRenting out your time means you\u2019re essentially replaceable\nAnd then finally you\u2019re actually just not even creating that much original for society. Like I said, this tweetstorm should have been called \u201cHow to Create Wealth.\u201d It\u2019s just \u201cHow to Get Rich\u201d was a more catchy title. But you\u2019re not creating new things for society. You\u2019re just doing things over and over.\nAnd you\u2019re essentially replaceable because you\u2019re now doing a set role. Most set roles can be taught. If they can be taught like in a school, then eventually you\u2019re gonna be competing with someone who\u2019s got more recent knowledge, who\u2019s been taught, and is coming in to replace you.\nYou\u2019re much more likely to be doing a job that can be eventually replaced by a robot, or by an AI. And it doesn\u2019t even have to be wholesale replaced over night. It can be replaced a little bit at a time. And that kind of eats into your wealth creation, and therefore your earning capability.\nSo, fundamentally your inputs are matched to your outputs. You are replaceable, and you\u2019re not being creative. I just don\u2019t think that, that is a way that you can truly make money.\nYou must own equity to gain your financial freedom\nSo everybody who really makes money at some point owns a piece of a product, or a business, or some kind of IP. That can be through stock options, so you can be working at a tech company. That\u2019s a fine way to start.\nBut usually the real wealth is created by starting your own companies, or by even investors. They\u2019re in an investment firm, and they\u2019re buying equity. These are much more the routes to wealth. It doesn\u2019t come through the hours.\nYou want a career where your inputs don\u2019t match your outputs\nYou really just want a job, or a career, or a profession where your inputs don\u2019t match your outputs. If you look at modern society, again this is later in the tweetstorm. Businesses that have high creativity and high leverage tends to be ones where you could do an hour of work, and it can have a huge effect. Or you can do 1,000 hours of work, and it can have no effect.\nFor example, look at software engineering. One great engineer can for example create bitcoin, and create billions of dollars worth of value. And an engineer who is working on the wrong thing, or not quite as good, or just not as creative, or thoughtful, or whatever, can work for an entire a year, and every piece of code they ship ends up not getting used. Customers don\u2019t want it.\nThat is an example of a profession where the input and the outputs are highly disconnected. It\u2019s not based on the number of hours that you put in.\nWhereas on the extreme other end, if you\u2019re a lumberjack, even the best lumberjack in the world, assuming you\u2019re not working with tools, so the inputs and outputs are clearly connected. You\u2019re just using an ax, or a saw. You know, the best lumberjack in the world may be like 3x better than one of the worst lumberjacks, right? It\u2019s not gonna be a gigantic difference.\nSo, you want to look for professions and careers where the inputs and outputs are highly disconnected. This is another way of saying that you want to look for things that are leveraged. And by leveraged I don\u2019t mean financial leveraged alone, like Wall Street uses, and that has a bad name. I\u2019m just talking about tools. We\u2019re using tools.\nA computer is a tool that software engineers use. If I\u2019m a lumberjack with bulldozers, and automatic robot axes, and saws, I\u2019m gonna be using tools, and have more leverage than someone who is just using his bare hands, and trying to rip the trees out by the roots.\nTools and leverage are what create this disconnection between inputs and outputs. Creativity, so the higher the creativity component of a profession, the more likely it is to have disconnected inputs and outputs.\nSo, I think that if you\u2019re looking at professions where your inputs and your outputs are highly connected, it\u2019s gonna be very, very, hard to create wealth, and make wealth for yourself in that process.\nLive Below Your Means for Freedom\nPeople busy upgrading their lifestyles just can\u2019t fathom this freedom\nPeople living below their means have freedom\nNivi: Any other big things you should avoid, other than renting out your time?\nNaval: Yeah, there are two tweets that I put out that are related. The first one I was talking about where someone, like, how your lifestyle has to upgrade, shouldn\u2019t get upgraded too fast. And that one basically said, people who are living far below their means enjoy a freedom that people busy upgrading their lifestyles just can\u2019t fathom.\nAnd I think that\u2019s very important, just to not upgrade your lifestyle all the time. To maintain your freedom. And it just gives you freedom of operation. You basically, once you make a little bit of money, you still want to be living like your old self, so that just the worry goes away. So, don\u2019t run out to upgrade that house, and lifestyle, and all that stuff.\nThe most dangerous things are heroin and a monthly salary\nLet\u2019s say you\u2019re getting paid $1,000 an hour. The problem is, is that when you go into a work lifestyle like that, you don\u2019t just suddenly go from making $20 an hour to making $1,000 an hour. That\u2019s a progression over a long career.\nAnd as that happens, one subtle problem is that you upgrade your lifestyle as you make more, and more money. And that upgrading of the lifestyle kind of ups what you consider to be wealth, and you stay in this wage slave trap.\nSo, I forget who said it, maybe it was Nassim Taleb. But he said, \u201cThe most dangerous things are heroin, and a monthly salary.\u201d Right, because they are highly addictive. The way you want to get wealthy is you want to be poor, and working, and working, and working.\nIdeally, you\u2019ll make your money in discrete lumps\nAnd this is for example how the tech industry works. Where you don\u2019t make any money for ten years, and then suddenly at year eleven, you might have a giant payday.\nWhich is by the way one reason why these very high marginal tax rates for the so-called wealthy are flawed because the highest risk-taking, most creative professions you literally lose money for a decade over your life, while you take massive risk, and you bleed, and bleed, and bleed.\nAnd then suddenly in year eleven, or year fifteen, you might have one single big payday. But then of course Uncle Sam show up, and basically say, \u201cHey, you know what, you just made a lot money this year. Therefore, you\u2019re rich. Therefore, you\u2019re evil and you\u2019ve got to hand it all over to us.\u201d So, it just destroys those kinds of creative risk taking professions.\nBut ideally you want to make your money in discrete lumps, separated over long periods of time, so that your own lifestyle does not have a chance to adapt quickly, and then you basically say, \u201cOkay, now I\u2019m done. Now I\u2019m retired. Now I\u2019m free. I\u2019m still gonna work because you got to do something with your life, but I\u2019m gonna work on only the things that I want, when I want.\u201d And so you have much more creative expression, and much less about money.\nGive Society What It Doesn\u2019t Know How to Get\nSociety will pay you for creating what it wants and delivering it at scale\nGive society what it wants, but doesn\u2019t know how to get\u2014at scale\nNivi: You\u2019re not gonna get rich renting out your time. But you say that, \u201cyou will get rich by giving society what it wants, but does not yet know how to get at scale.\u201d\nNaval: That\u2019s right. So, essentially as we talked about before, money is IOUs from society saying, \u201cYou did something good in the past. Now here\u2019s something that we owe you for the future.\u201d And so society will pay you for creating things that it wants.\nBut society doesn\u2019t yet know how to create those things because if it did, they wouldn\u2019t need you. They would already be stamped out big time.\nAlmost everything that\u2019s in your house, in your workplace, and on the street used to be technology at one point in time. There was a time when oil was a technology, that made J.D. Rockefeller rich. There was a time when cars were technology, that made Henry Ford rich.\nSo, technology is just the set of things, as Alan Kay said, that don\u2019t quite work yet [correction: Danny Hillis]. Once something works, it\u2019s no longer technology. So, society always wants new things.\nFigure out what product you can provide and then figure out how to scale it\nAnd if you want to be wealthy, you want to figure out which one of those things you can provide for society, that it does not yet know how to get, but it will want, that\u2019s natural to you, and within your skillset, within your capabilities.\nAnd then you have to figure out how to scale it. Because if you just build one of it, that\u2019s not enough. You\u2019ve got to build thousands, or hundreds of thousands, or millions, or billions of them. So, everybody can have one.\nSteve Jobs, and his team of course figured out that society would want smartphones. A computer in their pocket that had all the phone capability times 100, and be easy to use. So, they figured out how to build that, and then they figured out how to scale it.\nAnd they figured out how to get one into every First World citizen\u2019s pocket, and eventually every Third World citizen too. And so because of that they\u2019re handsomely rewarded, and Apple is the most valuable company in the world.\nNivi: The way I tried to put it was that the entrepreneur\u2019s job is to try to bring the high end to the mass market.\nNaval: It starts as high end. First it starts as an act of creativity. First you create it just because you want it. You want it, and you know how to build it, and you need it. And so you build it for yourself. Then you figure out how to get it to other people. And then for a little while rich people have it.\nLike, for example rich people had chauffeurs, and then they had black town cars. And then Uber came along, and everyone\u2019s private driver is available to everybody. And now you can even see Uber pools that are replacing shuttle buses because it\u2019s more convenient. And then you get scooters, which are even further down market of that. So, you\u2019re right. It\u2019s about distributing what rich people used to have to everybody.\nBut the entrepreneur\u2019s job starts even before that, which is creation. Entrepreneurship is essentially an act of creating something new from scratch. Predicting that society will want it, and then figuring out how to scale it, and get it to everybody in a profitable way, in a self-sustaining way.\nThe Internet Has Massively Broadened Career Possibilities\nThe Internet allows you to scale any niche obsession\nThe Internet has massively broadened the possible space of careers\nNivi: Let\u2019s look at this next tweet, which I thought was cryptic, and also super interesting, about the kind of job or career that you might have. You said, \u201cThe internet has massively broadened the possible space of careers. Most people haven\u2019t figured this out yet.\u201d\nNaval: The fundamental property of the internet more than any other single thing is it connects every human to each other human on the planet. You can now reach everyone.\nWhether it\u2019s by emailing them personally, whether it\u2019s by broadcasting to them on Twitter, whether it\u2019s by posting something on Facebook that they find, whether it\u2019s by putting up a website they come and access.\nIt connects everyone to everyone. So, the internet is an inter-networking tool. It connects everybody. That is its superpower. So, you want to use that.\nWhat that helps you figure out is the internet means you can find your audience for your product, or your talent, and skill no matter how far away they are.\nFor example, Nenad, who is Illacertus, if you look at his videos pre-internet, how would he get the message out there? It would just be \u2026 what would he do? He would run around where he lives in his neighborhood showing it to people on a computer, or a screen? Or he would try to get it played at his local movie theater? It was impossible. It only works because he can put it on the internet.\nAnd then how many people in the world are really interested in it? Or even in interested in what we\u2019re talking about are really gonna absorb it, right? It\u2019s gonna be a very small subset of humanity. The key is being able to reach them.\nThe Internet allows you to scale any niche obsession\nSo, what the internet does is allows any niche obsession, which could be just the weirdest thing. It could be like people who collect snakes, to like people who like to ride hot air balloons, to people who like to sail around the world by themselves, just one person on a craft, or someone who\u2019s obsessed with miniature cooking. Like, there\u2019s this whole Japanese miniature cooking phenomenon. Or there\u2019s a show about a woman who goes in people\u2019s houses, and tidies it up, right?\nSo, whatever niche obsession you have, the internet allows you to scale. Now that\u2019s not to say that what you build will be the next Facebook, or reach billions of users, but if you just want to reach 50,000 passionate people like you, there\u2019s an audience out there for you.\nSo the beauty of this is that we have 7 billion human beings on the planet. The combinatorics of human DNA are incredible. Everyone is completely different. You\u2019ll never meet any two people who are even vaguely similar to each other, that can substitute for each other.\nIt\u2019s not like you can say, \u201cWell, Nivi, just left my life. So, I can have this other person come in, and he\u2019s just like Nivi. And I get the same feelings, and the same responses, and the same ideas.\u201d No. There are no substitutes for people. People are completely unique.\nSo, given that each person has different skillsets, different interests, different obsessions. And it\u2019s that diversity that becomes a creative superpower. So, each person can be creatively superb at their own unique thing.\nBut before that didn\u2019t matter. Because if you were living in a little fishing village in Italy, like your fishing village didn\u2019t necessarily need your completely unique skill, and you had to conform to just the few jobs that were available. But now today you can be completely unique.\nYou can go out on the internet, and you can find your audience. And you can build a business, and create a product, and build wealth, and make people happy just uniquely expressing yourself through the internet.\nThe space of careers has been so broadened. E-sports players, you know, people making millions of dollars playing Fortnite. People creating videos, and uploading them. YouTube broadcasters. Bloggers, podcasters. Joe Rogan, I read, true or false, I don\u2019t know, but I read that he\u2019s gonna make about $100 million a year on his podcast. And he\u2019s had 2 billion downloads.\nEven PewDiePie\u2026 there\u2019s a hilarious tweet that I retweeted the other day. PewDiePie is the number one trusted name in news. This is a kid I think in Sweden, and he\u2019s got three times the distribution of the top cable news networks. Just on his news channel. It\u2019s not even on his entertainment channel.\nEscape competition through authenticity\nThe internet enables any niche interest, as long as you\u2019re the best at it to scale out. And the great news is because every human is different, everyone is the best at something. Being themselves.\nAnother tweet I had that is worth kind of weaving in, but didn\u2019t go into this tweetstorm, was a very simple one. I like things when I can compress them down because they\u2019re easy to remember, and easy to hook onto. But that one was, \u201cEscape competition through authenticity.\u201d\nBasically, when you\u2019re competing with people it\u2019s because you\u2019re copying them. It\u2019s because you\u2019re trying to do the same thing. But every human is different. Don\u2019t copy.\nI know we\u2019re mimetic creatures, and Ren\u00e9 Girard has a whole mimesis theory. But it\u2019s much easier than that. Don\u2019t imitate. Don\u2019t copy. Just do your own thing. No one can compete with you on being you. It\u2019s that simple.\nAnd so the more authentic you are to who you are, and what you love to do, the less competition you\u2019re gonna have. So, you can escape competition through authenticity when you realize that no one can compete with you on being you. And normally that would have been useless advice pre-internet. Post-internet you can turn that into a career.\nPlay Long-Term Games With Long-Term People\nAll returns in life come from compound interest in long-term games\nPlay long-term games with long-term people\nNivi: Talk a little bit about what industries you should think about working in. What kind of job you should have? And who you might want to work with? So, you said, \u201cOne should pick an industry where you can play long-term games with long-term people.\u201d Why?\nNaval: Yeah, this is an insight into what makes Silicon Valley work, and what makes high trust societies work. Essentially, all the benefits in life come from compound interests. Whether it\u2019s in relationships, or making money, or in learning.\nSo, compound interest is a marvelous force, where if you start out with 1x what you have, and then if you increase 20% a year for 30 years, it\u2019s not that you got 30 years times 20% added on. It was compounding, so it just grew, and grew, and grew until you suddenly got a massive amount of whatever it is. Whether it\u2019s goodwill, or love, or relationships, or money. So, I think compound interest is a very important force.\nYou have to be able to play a long-term game. And long-term games are good not just for compound interest, they\u2019re also good for trust. If you look at prisoner\u2019s dilemma type games, a solution to prisoner\u2019s dilemma is tit-for-tat, which is I\u2019m just going do to you what you did last time to me, with some forgiveness in case there was a mistake made. But that only works in an iterated prisoner\u2019s dilemma, in another words if we play a game multiple times.\nSo, if you\u2019re in a situation, like for example you\u2019re in Silicon Valley, where people are doing business with each other, and they know each other, they trust each other. Then they do right by each other because they know this person will be around for the next game.\nNow of course that doesn\u2019t always work because you can make so much money in one move in Silicon Valley, sometimes people betray each other because they\u2019re just like, \u201cI\u2019m going to get rich enough off this that I don\u2019t care.\u201d So, there can be exceptions to all these circumstances.\nBut essentially if you want to be successful, you have to work with other people. And you have to figure out who can you trust, and who can you trust over a long, long period of time, that you can just keep playing the game with them, so that compound interest, and high trust will make it easier to play the game, and will let you collect the major rewards, which are usually at the end of the cycle.\nSo, for example, Warren Buffett has done really well as an investor in the U.S. stock market, but the biggest reason he could do that was because the U.S. stock market has been stable, and around, and didn\u2019t get for example seized by the government during a bad administration. Or the U.S. didn\u2019t plunge into some war. The underlying platform didn\u2019t get destroyed. So, in his case, he was playing a longterm game. And the trust came from the U.S. stock market\u2019s stability.\nWhen you switch industries, you\u2019re starting over from scratch\nIn Silicon Valley, the trust comes from the network of people in the small geographic area, that you figure out over time who you can work with, and who you can\u2019t.\nIf you keep switching locations, you keep switching groups\u2026 let\u2019s say you started out in the woodworking industry, and you built up a network there. And you\u2019re working hard, you\u2019re trying to build a product in the woodworking industry. And then suddenly another industry comes along that\u2019s adjacent but different, but you don\u2019t really know anybody in it, and you want to dive in, and make money there.\nIf you keep hopping from industry to \u2026 \u201cNo, actually I need to open a line of electric car stations for electric car refueling.\u201d That might make sense. That might be the best opportunity. But every time you reset, every time you wander out of where you built your network, you\u2019re going to be starting from scratch. You\u2019re not going to know who to trust. They\u2019re not going to know to trust you.\nThere are also industries in which people are transient by definition. They\u2019re always coming in and going out. Politics is an example of that, right? In politics new people are being elected. You see in politics that when you have a lot of old-timers, like the Senate, people who have been around for a long time, and they\u2019ve been career politicians.\nThere\u2019s a lot of downside to career politicians like corruption. But an upside is they actually get deals done with each other because they know the other person is going to be in the same position ten years from now, and they\u2019re going to have to keep dealing with them, so they might as well learn how to cooperate.\nWhereas every time you get a new incoming freshman class in the House of Representatives, which turns over every two years with a big wave election. Nothing gets done because of a lot fighting. \u201cBecause I just got here, I don\u2019t know you, I don\u2019t know if you\u2019re going to be around, why should I work with you rather than just try to do whatever I think is right?\u201d\nSo, it\u2019s important to pick an industry where you can play long-term games, and with long-term people. So, those people have to signal that they\u2019re going to be around for a long time. That they\u2019re ethical. And their ethics are visible through their actions.\nLong-term players make each other rich\nNivi: In a long-term game, it seems that everybody is making each other rich. And in a short-term game, it seems like everybody is making themselves rich.\nNaval: I think that is a brilliant formulation. In a longterm game, it\u2019s positive sum. We\u2019re all baking the pie together. We\u2019re trying to make it as big as possible. And in a short term game, we\u2019re cutting up the pie.\nNow this is not to excuse the socialists, right? The socialists are the people who are not involved in baking the pie, who show up at the end, and say, \u201cI want a slice, or I want the whole pie.\u201d They show up with the guns.\nBut I think a good leader doesn\u2019t take credit. A good leader basically tries to inspire people, so the team gets the job done. And then things get divided up according to fairness, and who contributed how much, or as close to it as possible, and took a risk, as opposed to just whoever has the longest knife\u2026 the sharpest knife at the end.\nReturns come from compound interest in iterated games\nNivi: So, these next two tweets are, \u201cPlay iterated games. All returns in life, whether in wealth, relationships, or knowledge come from compound interest.\u201d\nNaval: When you have been doing business with somebody, you\u2019ve been friends with somebody for ten years, twenty years, thirty years, it just gets better and better because you trust them so easily. The friction goes down, you can do bigger, and bigger things together.\nFor example, the simplest one is getting married to someone, and having kids, and raising children. That\u2019s compound interest, right? Investing in those relationships. Those relationships end up being invaluable compared to more casual relationships.\nIt\u2019s true in health and fitness. You know, the fitter you are, the easier it is to stay fit. Whereas the more you deteriorate your body, the harder it is to come back, and claw your way back to a baseline. It requires heroic acts.\nNivi: Regarding compound interest, I think I saw retweet something a while back. Maybe it was from Ed Latimore. It went something along the lines of, \u201cGet some traction. Get purchase, and don\u2019t lose it\u201d [correction: the tweet is by @mmay3r]. So, the idea was to gain some initial traction, and never fall back, just keep ratcheting up, and up.\nNaval: I don\u2019t remember it exactly. But I think that was right. Yes, it was like, \u201cGet traction, and don\u2019t let go.\u201d It was a good one, yes.\nPick Partners With Intelligence, Energy and Integrity\nYou can\u2019t compromise on any of these three\nPick business partners with high intelligence, energy and integrity\nNaval: In terms of picking people to work with, pick ones that have high intelligence, high energy, and high integrity, I find that\u2019s the three-part checklist that you cannot compromise on.\nYou need someone who is smart, or they\u2019ll head in the wrong direction. And you\u2019re not going to end up in the right place. You need someone high-energy because the world is full of smart, lazy people.\nWe all know people in our life who are really smart, but can\u2019t get out of bed, or lift a finger. And we also know people who are very high energy, but not that smart. So, they work hard, but they\u2019re sort of running in the wrong direction.\nAnd smart is not a pejorative. It\u2019s not meant to say someone is smart, someone else is stupid. But it\u2019s more that everyone is smart at different things. So, depending on what you want to do well, you have to find someone who is smart at that thing.\nAnd then energy, a lot of times people are unmotivated for a specific thing, but they\u2019re motivated for other things. So, for example, someone might be really unmotivated to go to a job, and sit in an office. But they might be really motivated to go paint, right?\nWell, in that case they should be a painter. They should be putting art up on the internet. Trying to figure out how to build a career out of that, rather than wearing a collar around their neck, and going to a dreary job.\nAnd then high integrity is the most important because otherwise if you\u2019ve got the other two, what you have is you have a smart and hard working crook, who\u2019s eventually going to cheat you. So, you have to figure out if the person is high-integrity.\nAnd as we talked about, the way you do that is through signals. And signals is what they do, not what they say. It\u2019s all the non-verbal stuff that they do when they think nobody is looking.\nMotivation has to come intrinsically\nNivi: With respect to the energy, there was this interesting thing from Sam Altman a while back, where he was talking about delegation, and he was saying, \u201cOne of the important things for delegation is, delegate to people who are actually good at the thing that you want them to do.\u201d\nIt\u2019s the most obvious thing, but it seems like\u2026 you want to partner with people who are naturally going to do the things that you want them to do.\nNaval: Yeah. I almost won\u2019t start a company, or hire a person, or work with somebody if I just don\u2019t think they\u2019re into what I want them to do.\nWhen I was younger, I used to try and talk people into things. I had this idea that you could sell someone into doing something. But you can\u2019t. You can\u2019t keep them motivated. You can get them inspired initially. It might work if you\u2019re a king like Henry V, and you\u2019re trying to get them to just charge into battle, and then they\u2019ll figure it out.\nBut if you\u2019re trying to keep someone motivated for the long-term, that motivation has to come intrinsically. You can\u2019t just create it, nor can you be the crutch for them if they don\u2019t have that intrinsic motivation. So, you have to make sure people actually are high-energy, and want to do what you want them to do, and what you want to work with them on.\nIntegrity is what someone does, despite what they say they do\nReading signals is very, very important. Signals are what people do despite what they say. So, it\u2019s important to pay attention to subtle signals. We all know that socially if someone treats a waiter, or waitress in a restaurant really badly, then it\u2019s only a matter of time until they treat you badly.\nIf somebody screws over an enemy, and is vindictive towards them, well it\u2019s only a matter of time before they redefine you from friend to enemy, and you feel their wrath. So, angry, outraged, vindictive, short-term thinking people are essentially that way in many interactions in real life.\nPeople are oddly consistent. That\u2019s one of the things you learn about them. So, you want to find long-term people. You want to find people who seem irrationally ethical.\nFor example, I had a friend of mine whose company I invested in, and the company failed, and he could have wiped out all of the investors. But he kept putting more and more personal money in. Through three different pivots he put personal money in until the company finally succeeded. And in the process, he never wiped out the investors.\nAnd I was always grateful to him for that. I said, \u201cWow, that\u2019s amazing that you were so good to your investors. You didn\u2019t wipe them out.\u201d And he got offended by that. He said, \u201cI didn\u2019t do it for you. I didn\u2019t do it for my investors. I did it for me. It\u2019s my own self-esteem. It\u2019s what I care about. That\u2019s how I live my life.\u201d That\u2019s the kind of person you want to work with.\nAnother quote that I like, I have a tweet on this. I think I read this somewhere else, so I\u2019m not taking credit for this. But I kind of modified it a little bit. Which is that \u201cself-esteem is the reputation that you have with yourself.\u201d You\u2019ll always know.\nSo, good people, moral people, ethical people, easy to work with people, reliable people, tend to have very high self-esteem because they have very good reputations with themselves, and they understand that.\nIt\u2019s not ego. Self-esteem and ego are different things. Because ego can be undeserved, but self-esteem at least you feel like you lived up to your own internal moral code of ethics.\nAnd so it\u2019s very hard to work with people who end up being low integrity. And it\u2019s hard to figure out who is high integrity and low integrity. Generally, the more someone is saying that they\u2019re moral, ethical, and high integrity, the less likely they are to be that way.\nIt\u2019s very much like status signalling. If you overtly bid for status, if you overtly talk about being high status, that is a low status move. If you openly talk about how honest, reliable, and trustworthy you are, you\u2019re probably not that honest and trustworthy. That is a characteristic of con men.\nSo, yeah, pick an industry in which you can play long-term games with long-term people.\nPartner With Rational Optimists\nDon\u2019t partner with cynics and pessimists; their beliefs are self-fulfilling\nDon\u2019t partner with pessimists\nNivi: Let\u2019s do this last tweet. You said, \u201cDon\u2019t partner with cynics, and pessimists. Their beliefs are self-fulfilling.\u201d\nNaval: Yes. Essentially, to create things, you have to be a rational optimist. Rational in the sense that you have to see the world for what it really is. And yet you have to be optimistic about your own capabilities, and your capability to get things done.\nWe all know people who are consistently pessimistic, who will shoot down everything. Everyone in their life has the helpful critical guy, right? He thinks he\u2019s being helpful, but he\u2019s actually being critical, and he\u2019s a downer on everything.\nThat person will not only never do anything great in their lives, they\u2019ll prevent other people around them from doing something great. They think their job is to shoot holes in things. And it\u2019s okay to shoot holes in things as long as you come up with a solution.\nThere\u2019s also the classic military line, \u201cEither lead, follow, or get out of the way.\u201d And these people want a fourth option, where they don\u2019t want to lead, they don\u2019t want to follow, but they don\u2019t want to get out of the way. They want to tell you why the thing is not going to work.\nAnd all the really successful people I know have a very strong action bias. They just do things. The easiest way to figure out if something is viable or not is by doing it. At least do the first step, and the second step, and the third, and then decide.\nSo, if you want to be successful in life, creating wealth, or having good relationships, or being fit, or even being happy, you need to have an action bias towards getting what you want.\nPartner with rational optimists\nAnd you have to be optimistic about it. Not irrationally. You know, there\u2019s nothing worse than someone who is foolhardy and chasing something that\u2019s not worth it.\nThat\u2019s why I say rational optimist. But you have to be rational. Know all the pitfalls. Know the downsides, but still keep your chin up.\nYou\u2019ve got one life on this planet. Why not try to build something big? This is the beauty of Elon Musk, and why I think he inspires so many people, it\u2019s just because he takes on really, really big audacious tasks. And he provides an example for people to think big.\nAnd it takes a lot of work to build even small things. I don\u2019t think the corner grocery store owner is working any less hard than Elon Musk, or pouring any less sweat and toil into it. Maybe even more.\nBut for whatever reason, education, circumstance, they didn\u2019t get the chance to think as big, so the outcome is not as big. So, it\u2019s just better to think big. Obviously, rationally, within your means, stay optimistic.\nThe cynics and the pessimists, what they\u2019re really saying, it\u2019s unfortunate, but they\u2019re basically saying, \u201cI\u2019ve given up. I don\u2019t think I can do anything. And so the world to me just looks like a world where nobody can do anything. And so why should you go do something because if you fail, then I\u2019m right, which is great. But if you succeed, then you just make me look bad.\u201d\nWe descended from pessimists\nNivi: Yes, it\u2019s probably better to be an irrational optimist, then it is to be a rational cynic.\nNaval: There\u2019s a completely rational frame on why you should be an optimist. Historically, if you go back 2,000 years, 5,000 years, 10,000 years, two people are wandering through a jungle, they hear a tiger. One\u2019s an optimist, and says, \u201cOh, it\u2019s not headed our way.\u201d The other one says, \u201cI\u2019m a pessimist, I\u2019m out of here.\u201d And the pessimist runs and survives, and the optimist gets eaten.\nSo, we\u2019re descended from pessimists. We\u2019re genetically hardwired to be pessimists. But modern society is far, far safer. There are no tigers wandering around the street. It\u2019s very unlikely that you will end up in total ruin, although you should avoid total ruin.\nMuch more likely that the upside is unlimited, and the downside is limited. So, adapting for modern society means overriding your pessimism, and taking slightly irrationally optimistic bets because the upside is unlimited if you start the next SpaceX, or Tesla, or Uber, you can make billions of dollars of value for society, and for yourself, and change the world.\nAnd if you fail, what\u2019s the big deal? You lost a few million dollars of investor money, and they\u2019ve got plenty more, and that\u2019s the bet they take on the chances that you will succeed.\nIt made sense to be pessimistic in the past. It makes sense to be optimistic today, especially if you\u2019re educated and living in a First World country. Even a Third World country. I actually think the economic opportunities in Third World countries are much larger.\nThe one thing you have to avoid is the risk of ruin. Ruin means stay out of jail. So, don\u2019t do anything that\u2019s illegal. It\u2019s never worth it to wear an orange jumpsuit. And stay out of total catastrophic loss. That could mean that you stay out of things that could be physically dangerous, hurt your body.\nYou have to watch your health. And stay out of things that can cause you to lose all of your capital, all of your savings. So, don\u2019t gamble everything on one go. But take rationally optimistic bets with big upside.\nBOCTAOE\nNivi: I think there\u2019s people that will try and build up your ideas, and build on your ideas, no matter how far fetched they might seem. And then there are people who list all of the obvious exceptions, no matter how obvious they are.\nAnd fortunately in the startup world, I don\u2019t even really get exposed to the people that are giving you the obvious exceptions, and all the reasons it\u2019s not going to work. I barely get exposed to that anymore.\nNaval: That\u2019s what Twitter is for. Scott Adams got so annoyed by this that he came up with a phrase, an acronym, which is \u201cbut of course there are obvious exceptions\u201d, BOCTAOE. And he used to pin that acronym at the end of his articles for a while.\nBut Twitter is overrun with nitpickers. Whereas exactly as you were pointing out, Silicon Valley has learned that the upside is so great that you never look down on the kid who\u2019s wearing a hoodie and has coffee on his shoes. And just looks like a slob because you don\u2019t know if he\u2019s going to be the next Mark Zuckerberg, or the next Reid Hoffman.\nSo, you\u2019ve got to treat everybody with respect. You\u2019ve got to look up to every possibility, and opportunity because the upside is so unlimited, and the downside is so limited in the modern world, especially with financial assets and instruments.\nArm Yourself With Specific Knowledge\nSpecific knowledge can be found by pursuing your genuine curiosity\nArm yourself with specific knowledge\nNivi: Do you want to talk a little bit about the skills that you need, in particular specific knowledge, accountability, leverage and judgment. So, the first tweet in this area is \u201cArm yourself with specific knowledge accountability and leverage.\u201d And I\u2019ll throw in judgment as well. I don\u2019t think you covered that in that particular tweet.\nNaval: If you want to make money you have to get paid at scale. And why you, that\u2019s accountability, at scale, that\u2019s leverage, and just you getting paid as opposed to somebody else getting paid , that\u2019s specific knowledge.\nSo, specific knowledge is probably the hardest thing to get across in this whole tweetstorm, and it\u2019s probably the thing that people get the most confused about.\nThe thing is that we have this idea that everything can be taught, everything can be taught in school. And it\u2019s not true that everything can be taught. In fact, the most interesting things cannot be taught. But everything can be learned. And very often that learning either comes from some innate characteristics in your DNA, or it could be through your childhood where you learn soft skills which are very, very hard to teach later on in life, or it\u2019s something that is brand new so nobody else knows how to do it either, or it\u2019s true on the job training because you\u2019re pattern matching into highly complex environments, basically building judgment in a specific domain.\nClassic example is investing, but it could be in anything. It could be in judgment in running a fleet of trucks, it could be judgment in weather forecasting.\nSo, specific knowledge is the knowledge that you care about. Especially if you\u2019re later in life, let\u2019s say your post 20, 21, 22, you almost don\u2019t get to choose which specific knowledge you have. Rather, you get to look at what you have already built by that point in time, and then you can build on top of it.\nSpecific knowledge can\u2019t be trained\nThe first thing to notice about specific knowledge is that you can\u2019t be trained for it. If you can be trained for it, if you can go to a class and learn specific knowledge, then somebody else can be trained for it too, and then we can mass-produce and mass-train people. Heck, we can even program computers to do it and eventually we can program robots to walk around doing it.\nSo, if that\u2019s the case, then you\u2019re extremely replaceable and all we have to pay you is the minimum wage that we have to pay you to get you to do it when there are lots of other takers who can be trained to do it. So really, your returns just devolve into your cost of training plus the return on investment on that training.\nSo, you really want to pick up specific knowledge, you need your schooling, you need your training to be able to capitalize on the best specific knowledge, but the part of it that you\u2019re going to get paid for is the specific knowledge.\nSpecific knowledge is found by pursuing your curiosity\nFor example, someone who goes and gets a degree in psychology and then becomes a salesperson. Well if they were already a formidable salesperson, a high grade salesmanship to begin with, then the psychology degree is leverage, it arms them and they do much better at sales.\nBut if they were always an introvert never very good at sales and they\u2019re trying to use psychology to learn sales, they\u2019re just not going to get that great at it.\nSo, specific knowledge is found much more by pursuing your innate talents, your genuine curiosity, and your passion. It\u2019s not by going to school for whatever is the hottest job, it\u2019s not for going into whatever field investors say is the hottest.\nVery often specific knowledge is at the edge of knowledge. It\u2019s also stuff that\u2019s just being figured out or is really hard to figure out.\nSo, if you\u2019re not 100% into it somebody else who is 100% into it will outperform you. And they won\u2019t just outperform you by a little bit, they\u2019ll outperform you by a lot because now we\u2019re operating the domain of ideas, compound interest really applies and leverage really applies.\nSo, if you\u2019re operating with 1,000 times leverage and somebody is right 80% of the time, and somebody else is right 90% of time, the person who\u2019s right 90% of the time will literally get paid hundreds of times more by the market because of the leverage and because of the compounding factors and being correct. So, you really want to make sure you\u2019re good at it so that genuine curiosity is very important.\nBuilding specific knowledge will feel like play to you\nSo, very often, it\u2019s not something you sit down and then you reason about, it\u2019s more found by observation. You almost have to look back on your own life and see what you\u2019re actually good at.\nFor example, I wanted to be a scientist and that is where a lot of my moral hierarchy comes from. I view scientists sort of at the top of the production chain for humanity. And the group of scientists who have made real breakthroughs and contributions that probably added more to human society, I think, than any single other class of human beings.\nNot to take away anything from art or politics or engineering or business, but without the science we\u2019d still be scrambling in the dirt fighting with sticks and trying to start fires.\nMy whole value system was built around scientists and I wanted to be a great scientist. But when I actually look back at what I was uniquely good at and what I ended up spending my time doing, it was more around making money, tinkering with technology, and selling people on things. Explaining things, talking to people.\nSo, I have some sales skills, which is a form specific knowledge that I have. I have some analytical skills around how to make money. And I have this ability to absorb data, obsess about it, and break it down and that is a specific skill that I have. I also just love tinkering with technology. And all of this stuff feels like play to me, but it looks like work to others.\nSo, there are other people to whom these things would be hard and they say like, \u201cWell, how do I get good at being pithy and selling ideas?\u201d Well, if you\u2019re not already good at it or if you\u2019re not really into it, maybe it\u2019s not your thing, focus on the thing that you are really into.\nThis is ironic, but the first person to actually point out my real specific knowledge was my mother. She did it as an aside, talking from the kitchen and she said it when I was like 15 or 16 years old. I was telling a friend of mine that I want to be an astrophysicist and she said, \u201cNo, you\u2019re going to go into business.\u201d\nI was like, \u201cWhat, my mom\u2019s telling me I\u2019m going to be in business. I\u2019m going to be an astrophysicist. Mom doesn\u2019t know she\u2019s talking about.\u201d But mom knew exactly what she was talking about.\nShe\u2019d already observed that every time we walk down the street, I would critique the local pizza parlor on why they were selling their slices a certain way with certain toppings and why their process of ordering was this way when it should have been that way.\nSo, she knew that I had more of a business curious mind, but then my obsession with science combined to create technology and technology businesses where I found myself.\nSo, very often, your specific knowledge is observed and often observed by other people who know you well and revealed in situations rather than something that you come up with.\nSpecific Knowledge Is Highly Creative or Technical\nSpecific knowledge is on the bleeding edge of technology, art and communication\nSpecific knowledge can be taught through apprenticeships\nNaval: To the extent that specific knowledge is taught, it\u2019s on the job. It\u2019s through apprenticeships. And that\u2019s why the best businesses, the best careers are the apprenticeship or self-taught careers, because those are things society still has not figured out how to train and automate yet.\nThe classic line here is that Warren Buffett went to Benjamin Graham when he got out of school. Benjamin Graham was the author of the Intelligent Investor and sort of modernized or created value investing as a discipline. And Warren Buffett went to Benjamin Graham and offered to work for him for free.\nAnd Graham said, \u201cActually, you\u2019re overpriced, free is overpriced.\u201d And Graham was absolutely right. When it comes to a very valuable apprenticeship like the type that Graham was going to give Buffet, Buffet should have been paying him a lot of money. That right there tells you that those are skills worth having.\nSpecific knowledge is often highly creative or technical\nSpecific knowledge also tends to be technical and creative. It\u2019s on the bleeding edge of technology, on the bleeding edge of art, on the bleeding edge of communication.\nEven today, for example, there are probably meme lords out there on the Internet who can create incredible memes that will spread the idea to millions of people. Or are very persuasive \u2013 Scott Adams is a good example of this. He is essentially becoming one of the most credible people in the world by making accurate predictions through persuasive arguments and videos.\nAnd that is specific knowledge that he has built up over the years because he got obsessed with hypnosis when he was young, he learned how to communicate through cartooning, he embraced Periscope early, so he\u2019s been practicing lots of conversation, he\u2019s read all the books on the topic, he\u2019s employed it in his everyday life. If you look at his girlfriend, she\u2019s this beautiful young Instagram model.\nThat is an example of someone who has built up a specific knowledge over the course of his career. It\u2019s highly creative, it has elements of being technical in it, and it\u2019s something that is never going to be automated.\nNo one\u2019s going to take that away from him, because he\u2019s also accountable under one brand as Scott Adams, and he\u2019s operating with the leverage of media with Periscope and drawing Dilbert cartoons and writing books. He has massive leverage on top of that brand and he can build wealth out of it if he wanted to build additional wealth beyond what he already has.\nSpecific knowledge is specific to the individual and situation\nNivi: Should we be calling it unique knowledge or does specific knowledge somehow make more sense for it?\nNaval: You know, I came up with this framework when I was really young. We\u2019re talking decades and decades. It\u2019s now probably over 30 years old. So, at the time specific knowledge stuck with me so that is how I think about it.\nThe reason I didn\u2019t try and change it is because every other term that I found for it was overloaded in a different way. At least specific knowledge isn\u2019t that used. I can kind of rebrand it.\nThe problem with unique knowledge is, yeah, maybe it\u2019s unique but if I learn it from somebody else it\u2019s no longer unique, then we both know it. So, it\u2019s not so much that it is unique, it\u2019s that it is highly specific to the situation, it\u2019s specific to the individual, it\u2019s specific to the problem, and it can only be built as part of a larger obsession, interest, and time spent in that domain.\nIt can\u2019t just be read straight out of a single book, nor can it be taught in a single course, nor can it be programmed into a single algorithm.\nYou can\u2019t be too deliberate about assembling specific knowledge\nNivi: Speaking of Scott Adams, he\u2019s got a blog post on how to build your career by getting in, say, the top 25 percentile at three or more things. And by doing that, you become the only person in the world who can do those three things in the 25th percentile.\nSo, instead of trying to be the best at one thing, you just try to be very, very good at three or more things. Is that a way of building specific knowledge?\nNaval: I actually think the best way is just to follow your own obsession. And somewhere in the back of your mind, you can realize that, actually, this obsession I like and I\u2019ll keep an eye out for the commercial aspects of it.\nBut I think if you go around trying to build it a little too deliberately, if you become too goal-oriented on the money, then you won\u2019t pick the right thing. You won\u2019t actually pick the thing that you love to do, so you won\u2019t go deep enough into it.\nScott Adams\u2019 observation is a good one, predicated on statistics. Let\u2019s say there\u2019s 10,000 areas that are valuable to the human race today in terms of knowledge to have, and the number one in those 10,000 slots is taken.\nSomeone else is likely to be the number one in each of those 10,000, unless you happen to be one of the 10,000 most obsessed people in the world that at a given thing.\nBut when you start combining, well, number 3,728 with top-notch sales skills and really good writing skills and someone who understands accounting and finance really well, when the need for that intersection arrives, you\u2019ve expanded enough from 10,000 through combinatorics to millions or tens of millions. So, it just becomes much less competitive.\nAlso, there\u2019s diminishing returns. So, it\u2019s much easier to be top 5 percentile at three or four things than it is to be literally the number one at something.\nBuild specific knowledge where you are a natural\nI think it\u2019s a very pragmatic approach. But I think it\u2019s important that one not start assembling things too deliberately because you do want to pick things where you are a natural. Everyone is a natural at something.\nWe\u2019re all familiar with that phrase, a natural. \u201cOh, this person is a natural at meeting men or women, this person is a natural socialite, this person is a natural programmer, this person is a natural reader.\u201d So, whatever you are a natural at, you want to double down on that.\nAnd then there are probably multiple things you\u2019re natural at because personalities and humans are very complex. So, we want to be able to take the things that you are natural at and combine them so that you automatically, just through sheer interest and enjoyment, end up top 25% or top 10% or top 5% at a number of things.\nLearn to Sell, Learn to Build\nIf you can do both, you will be unstoppable\nLearn to sell, learn to build\nNivi: Talking about combining skills, you said that you should \u201clearn to sell, learn to build, if you can do both, you will be unstoppable.\u201d\nNaval: This is a very broad category. It\u2019s two broad categories. One is building the product. Which is hard, and it\u2019s multivariate. It can include design, it can include development, it can include manufacturing, logistics, procurement, it can even be designing and operating a service. It has many, many definitions.\nBut in every industry, there is a definition of the builder. In our tech industry it\u2019s the CTO, it\u2019s the programmer, it\u2019s the software engineer, hardware engineer. But even in the laundry business, it could be the person who\u2019s building the laundry service, who is making the trains run on time, who\u2019s making sure all the clothes end up in the right place at the right time, and so on.\nThe other side of it is sales. Again, selling has a very broad definition. Selling doesn\u2019t necessarily just mean selling individual customers, but it can mean marketing, it can mean communicating, it can mean recruiting, it can mean raising money, it can mean inspiring people, it could mean doing PR. It\u2019s a broad umbrella category.\nThe Silicon Valley model is a builder and seller\nSo, generally, the Silicon Valley startup model tends to work best. It\u2019s not the only way, but it is probably the most common way, when you have two founders, one of whom is world class at selling, and one of whom is world class at building.\nExamples are, of course, Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak with Apple, Gates and Allen probably had similar responsibilities early on with Microsoft, Larry and Sergey probably broke down along those lines, although it\u2019s a little different there because that was a very technical product delivered to end users through a simple interface.\nBut generally, you will see this pattern repeated over and over. There\u2019s a builder and there\u2019s a seller. There\u2019s a CEO and CTO combo. And venture and technology investors are almost trained to look for this combo whenever possible. It\u2019s the magic combination.\nIf you can do both you will be unstoppable\nThe ultimate is when one individual can do both. That\u2019s when you get true superpowers. That\u2019s when you get people who can create entire industries.\nThe living example is Elon Musk. He may not necessarily be building the rockets himself, but he understands enough that he actually makes technical contributions. He understands the technology well enough that no one\u2019s going to snow him on it, and he\u2019s not running around making claims that he doesn\u2019t think he can\u2019t eventually deliver. He may be optimistic on the timelines but he thinks this is within reasonableness for delivery.\nEven Steve Jobs developed enough product skills and was involved enough in the product that he also operated in both of these domains. Larry Ellison started as a programmer and I think wrote the first version of Oracle, or was actually heavily involved in it.\nMarc Andreessen was also in this domain. He may not have had enough confidence in his sales skills, but he was the programmer who wrote Netscape Navigator, or a big chunk of it. So, I think the real giants in any field are the people who can both build and sell.\nI\u2019d rather teach an engineer marketing than a marketer engineering\nAnd usually the building is a thing that a sales person can\u2019t pick up later in life. It requires too much focused time. But a builder can pick up selling a little bit later, especially if they were already innately wired to be a good communicator. Bill Gates famously paraphrases this as, \u201cI\u2019d rather teach an engineer marketing, than a marketer engineering.\u201d\nI think if you start out with a building mentality and you have building skills and it\u2019s still early enough in your life, or you have enough focused time that you think you can learn selling, and you have some natural characteristics or you\u2019re a good salesperson, then you can double down on those.\nNow, your sales skills could be in a different than traditional domain. For example, let\u2019s say you\u2019re a really good engineer and then people are saying, well, now you need to be good at sales, well, you may not be good at hand-to-hand sales, but you may be a really good writer.\nAnd writing is a skill that can be learned much more easily than, say, in-person selling, and so you may just cultivate writing skills until you become a good online communicator and then use that for your sales.\nOn the other hand, it could just be that you\u2019re a good builder and you\u2019re bad at writing and you don\u2019t like communicating to mass audiences but you\u2019re good one-on-one, so then you might use your sales skills for recruiting or for fundraising, which are more one-on-one kinds of endeavors.\nThis is pointing out that if you\u2019re at the intersection of these two, don\u2019t despair because you\u2019re not going to be the best technologist and you\u2019re not going to be the best salesperson, but in a weird way, that combination, back to the Scott Adams skill stack, that combination of two skills is unstoppable.\nLong term, people who understand the underlying product and how to build it and can sell it, these are catnip to investors, these people can break down walls if they have enough energy, and they can get almost anything done.\nNivi: If you could only pick one to be good at, which one would you pick?\nNaval: When you\u2019re trying to stand out from the noise building is actually better because there\u2019re so many hustlers and sales people who have nothing to back them up. When you\u2019re starting out, when you\u2019re trying to be recognized, building is better.\nBut much later down the line building gets exhausting because it is a focus job and it\u2019s hard to stay current because there\u2019s always new people, new products coming up who have newer tools, and frankly more time because it\u2019s very intense, it\u2019s a very focused task.\nSo, sales skills actually scale better over time. Like for example, if you have a reputation for building a great product, that\u2019s good, but when you ship your new product, I\u2019m going to validate it based on the product. But if you have a reputation for being a good person to do business with and you\u2019re persuasive and communicative then that reputation almost becomes self-fulfilling.\nSo, I think if you only had to pick up one, you can start with building and then transition to selling. This is a cop-out answer, but I think that is actually the right answer.\nRead What You Love Until You Love to Read\nYou should be able to pick up any book in the library and read it\nRead what you love until you love to read\nNivi: Before we go and talk about accountability and leverage and judgment, you\u2019ve got a few tweets further down the line that I would put in the category of continuous learning.\nThey\u2019re essentially, \u201cthere is no skill called business. Avoid business magazines and business class, study microeconomics, game theory, psychology, persuasion, ethics, mathematics and computers.\u201d\nThere\u2019s one other comment that you made in a Periscope that was, \u201cyou should be able to pick up any book in the library and read it.\u201d And the last tweet in this category was, \u201creading is faster than listening, doing is faster than watching.\u201d\nNaval: Yeah, the most important tweet on this, I don\u2019t even have in here unfortunately, which is, the foundation of learning is reading. I don\u2019t know a smart person who doesn\u2019t read and read all the time.\nAnd the problem is, what do I read? How do I read? Because for most people it\u2019s a struggle, it\u2019s a chore. So, the most important thing is just to learn how to educate yourself and the way to educate yourself is to develop a love for reading.\nSo, the tweet that is left out, the one that I was hinting at is, \u201cread what you love until you love to read.\u201d It\u2019s that simple.\nEverybody I know who reads a lot loves to read, and they love to read because they read books that they loved. It\u2019s a little bit of a catch-22, but you basically want to start off just reading wherever you are and then keep building up from there until reading becomes a habit. And then eventually, you will just get bored of the simple stuff.\nSo you may start off reading fiction, then you might graduate to science fiction, then you may graduate to non-fiction, then you may graduate to science, or philosophy, or mathematics or whatever it is, but take your natural path and just read the things that interest you until you kind of understand them. And then you\u2019ll naturally move to the next thing and the next thing and the next thing.\nRead the original scientific books in a field\nNow, there is an exception to this, which is where I was hinting with what things you actually do want to learn, which is, at some point there\u2019s too much out there to read. Even reading is full of junk.\nThere are actually things you can read, especially early on, that will program your brain a certain way, and then later things that you read, you will decide whether those things are true or false based on the earlier things.\nSo, it is important that you read foundational things. And foundational things, I would say, are the original books in a given field that are very scientific in their nature.\nFor example, instead of reading a business book, pick up Adam Smith\u2019s The Wealth of Nations. Instead of reading a book on biology or evolution that\u2019s written today, I would pick up Darwin\u2019s Origin of the Species. Instead of reading a book on biotech right now that may be very advanced, I would just pick up The Eighth Day of Creation by Watson and Crick. Instead of reading advanced books on what cosmology and what Neil Degrasse Tyson and Stephen Hawking have been saying, you can pick up Richard Feynman\u2019s Six Easy Pieces and start with basic physics.\nDon\u2019t fear any book\nIf you understand the basics, especially in mathematics and physics and sciences, then you will not be afraid of any book. All of us have that memory of when we were sitting in class and we\u2019re learning mathematics, and it was all logical and all made sense until at one point the class moved too fast and we fell behind.\nThen after that we were left memorizing equations, memorizing concepts without being able to derive them from first principles. And at that moment, we\u2019re lost, because unless you\u2019re a professional mathematician, you\u2019re not going to remember those things. All you\u2019re going to remember are the techniques, the foundations.\nSo, you have to make sure that you\u2019re building on a steel frame of understanding because you\u2019re putting together a foundation for skyscraper, and you\u2019re not just memorizing things because you\u2019re just memorizing things you\u2019re lost. So the foundations are ultra important.\nAnd the ultimate, the ultimate is when you walk into a library and you look at it up and down and you don\u2019t fear any book. You know that you can take any book off the shelf, you can read it, you can understand it, you can absorb what is true, you can reject what is false, and you have a basis for even working that out that is logical and scientific and not purely just based on opinions.\nThe means of learning are abundant; the desire to learn is scarce\nThe beauty of the internet is the entire library of Alexandria times 10 is at your fingertips at all times. It\u2019s not the means of education or the means of learning are scarce, the means of learning are abundant. It\u2019s the desire to learn that\u2019s scarce. So, you really have to cultivate the desire.\nAnd it\u2019s not even cultivating you\u2019ve to not lose it. Children have a natural curiosity. If you go to a young child who\u2019s first learning language, they\u2019re pretty much always asking: What\u2019s this? What\u2019s that? Why is this? Who\u2019s that? They\u2019re always asking questions.\nBut one of the problems is that schools and our educational system, and even our way of raising children replaces curiosity with compliance. And once you replace the curiosity with the compliance, you get an obedient factory worker, but you no longer get a creative thinker. And you need creativity, you need the ability to feed your own brain to learn whatever you want.\nThe Foundations Are Math and Logic\nMathematics and logic are the basis for understanding everything else\nThe ultimate foundations are math and logic\nNaval: Foundational things are principles, they\u2019re algorithms, they\u2019re deep seated logical understanding where you can defend it or attack it from any angle. And that\u2019s why microeconomics is important because macroeconomics is a lot of memorization, a lot of macro bullshit.\nAs Nassim Taleb says, it is easier to macro bullshit than it is the micro bullshit. Because macroeconomics is voodoo-complex-science meets politics. You can\u2019t find two macroeconomists to agree on anything these days, and different macroeconomists get used by different politicians to peddle their different pet theories.\nThere are even macroeconomists out there now peddling something called Modern Monetary Theory which basically says, hey, except for this pesky thing called inflation, we can just print all the money that we want. Yes, except for this pesky thing called inflation. That\u2019s like saying, except for limited energy, we can fire rockets off into space all day long.\nIt\u2019s just nonsense, but the fact that there are people who have \u201cmacroeconomist\u201d in their title and are peddling Modern Monetary Theory just tells you that macroeconomics as a so-called science has been corrupted. It\u2019s now a branch of politics.\nSo, you really want to focus on the foundations. The ultimate foundation are mathematics and logic. If you understand logic and mathematics, then you have the basis for understanding the scientific method. Once you understand the scientific method, then you can understand how to separate truth from falsehood in other fields and other things that you\u2019re reading.\nIt\u2019s better to read a great book slowly than to fly through a hundred books quickly\nSo, be very careful about reading other people\u2019s opinions and even be careful when reading facts because so-called facts are often just opinions with a veneer [of pseudoscience] around them.\nWhat you are really looking for are algorithms. What you are really looking for is understanding. It\u2019s better to go through a book really slowly and struggle and stumble and rewind, than it is to fly through it quickly and say, \u201cWell, now I\u2019ve read 20 books, I\u2019ve read 30 books, I\u2019ve read 50 books in the field.\u201d\nIt\u2019s like Bruce Lee said, \u201cI don\u2019t fear the man who knows a thousand kicks and a thousand punches, I fear the man who\u2019s practiced one punch ten thousand times or one kick ten thousand times.\u201d It\u2019s that understanding that comes through repetition and through usage and through logic and foundations that really makes you a smart thinker.\nLearn persuasion and programming\nNivi: To lay a foundation for learning for the rest of your life I think you need two things, if I was going to try and sum it up. One, practical persuasion and two, you need to go deep in some technical category, whether it\u2019s abstract math, or you want to read Donald Knuth\u2019s books on algorithms, or you want to read Feynman\u2019s lectures on physics.\nIf you have practical persuasion and a deep understanding of some complex topic, I think you\u2019ll have a great foundation for learning for the rest of your life.\nNaval: Yeah. In fact let me expand that a little bit. I would say that the five most important skills are of course, reading, writing, arithmetic, and then as you\u2019re adding in, persuasion, which is talking. And then finally, I would add computer programming just because it\u2019s an applied form of arithmetic that just gets you so much leverage for free in any domain that you operate in.\nIf you\u2019re good with computers, if you\u2019re good at basic mathematics, if you\u2019re good at writing, if you\u2019re good at speaking, and if you like reading, you\u2019re set for life.\nThere\u2019s No Actual Skill Called \u2018Business\u2019\nAvoid business schools and magazines\nThere\u2019s no actual skill called \u2018business\u2019\nNaval: In that sense, business to me is bottom of the barrel. There\u2019s no actual skill called business, it\u2019s too generic. It\u2019s like a skill called \u201crelating.\u201d Like \u201crelating to humans.\u201d That\u2019s not a skill, it\u2019s too broad.\nA lot of what goes on in business schools, and there is some very intelligent stuff taught in business schools \u2013 I don\u2019t mean to detract from them completely \u2013 some of the things taught in business school are just anecdotes. They call them \u201ccase studies.\u201d\nBut they\u2019re just anecdotes, and they\u2019re trying to help you pattern match by throwing lots of data points at you, but the reality is, you will never understand them fully until you\u2019re actually in that position yourself.\nEven then you will find that basic concepts from game theory, psychology, ethics, mathematics, computers, and logic will serve you much, much better.\nI would focus on the foundations, I would focus with a science bent. I would develop a love for reading, including by reading so-called junk food that you\u2019re not supposed to read. You don\u2019t have to read the classics. That [reading] is the foundation for your self-education.\nDoing is faster than watching\nNivi: What did you mean when you said that \u201cdoing is faster than watching?\u201d\nNaval: When it comes to your learning curve, if you want to optimize your learning curve\u2026 One of the reasons why I don\u2019t love podcasts, even though I\u2019m a generator of podcasts, is that I like to consume my information very quickly.\nAnd I\u2019m a good reader, or a fast reader and I can read very fast but I can only listen at a certain speed. I know people listen at 2x, 3x, but everyone sounds like a chipmunk and it\u2019s hard to go back, it\u2019s hard to highlight, it\u2019s hard to pinpoint snippets and save them in your notebook, and so on.\nSimilarly, a lot of people think they can become really skilled at something by watching others do it, or even by reading about others doing it. And going back to the business school case study, that\u2019s a classic example.\nThey study other people\u2019s businesses, but in reality, you\u2019re going to learn a lot more about running a business by operating your own lemonade stand or equivalent. Or even opening a little retail store down the street.\nThat is how you\u2019re going to learn on the job because a lot of the subtleties don\u2019t express themselves until you\u2019re actually in the business.\nFor example, everyone\u2019s into mental models these days. You go to Farnam Street, you go to Poor Charlie\u2019s Almanack, and you can learn all the different mental models. But which ones matter more? Which ones do you apply more often? Which ones matter in which circumstances? That\u2019s actually the hard part.\nFor example, my personal learning has been that the principal-agent problem drives so much in this world. It\u2019s an incentives problem. I\u2019ve learned that tit-for-tat iterated prisoner\u2019s dilemma is the piece of game theory that is worth knowing the most. You can almost put down the game theory book after that.\nBy the way, the best way to learn game theory is to play lots of games. I never even read game theory books. I consider myself extremely good at game theory. I\u2019ve never opened up a game theory book and found a result in there where I didn\u2019t think, \u201cOh, yeah, that\u2019s common sense to me.\u201d\nThe reason is that I grew up playing all kinds of games and I ran into all kinds of corner cases with all kinds of friends, and so it\u2019s just second nature to me. You can always learn better by doing it on the job.\nThe number of \u2018doing\u2019 iterations drives the learning curve\nBut doing is a subtle thing. Doing encapsulates a lot. For example, let\u2019s say, I want to learn how to run a business. Well, if I start a business where I go in every day and I\u2019m doing the same thing, let\u2019s say I\u2019m running a retail store down the street where I\u2019m stocking the shelves with food and liquor every single day, I\u2019m not going to learn that much because I\u2019m repeating things a lot.\nSo, I\u2019m putting in thousands of hours, but they are thousands of hours doing the same thing. Whereas if I was putting in thousands of iterations, that would be different. So, the learning curve is across iterations [not iterations].\nSo if I was trying new marketing experiments in the store all the time, I was constantly changing up the inventory, I was constantly changing up the branding and the messaging, I was constantly changing the sign, I was constantly changing the online channels that are used to drive foot traffic in, I was experimenting with being open at different hours, I had the ability to walk around and talk to other store owners and getting their books and figure out how they run their businesses.\nIt\u2019s the number of iterations that drives the learning curve. So, the more iterations you can have, the more shots on goal you can have, the faster you\u2019re going to learn. It\u2019s not just about the hours put in.\nIf you\u2019re willing to bleed a little every day, you may win big later\nIt\u2019s actually a combination of the two, but I think just the way we\u2019re built and the way that the world presents itself, the world offers us very easily the opportunity to do the same thing over and over and over again. But really, we\u2019d be better served if we went off and found ways to do new things from scratch.\nAnd doing something new the first time is painful, because you\u2019re wandering into uncertain territory and high odds are that you will fail. So you just have to get very, very comfortable with frequent small failures.\nNassim Taleb talks about this also. He made his fortune, his wealth by being a trader who basically relied upon black swans. Nassim Taleb made money by losing little bits of money every day and then once in a blue moon he would make a lot of money when the unthinkable happened for other people.\nWhereas most people want to make little bits of money every day and in exchange they\u2019ll tolerate lots of blow-up risk, they\u2019ll tolerate going completely bankrupt.\nWe\u2019re not evolved to bleed a little bit every day. If you\u2019re out in the natural environment, and you get a cut and you\u2019re literally bleeding a little bit every day, you will eventually die. You\u2019ll have to stop that cut.\nWe\u2019re evolved for small victories all the time but that becomes very expensive. That\u2019s where the crowd is. That\u2019s where the herd is. So, if you\u2019re willing to bleed a little bit every day but in exchange you\u2019ll win big later, you will do better.\nThat is, by the way, entrepreneurship. Entrepreneurs bleed every day.\nThey\u2019re not making money, they\u2019re losing money, they\u2019re constantly stressed out, all the responsibility is upon them, but when they win they win big. On average they\u2019ll make more.\nEmbrace Accountability to Get Leverage\nTake risks under your own name and society will reward you with leverage\nYou need accountability to get leverage\nNivi: Why don\u2019t we jump into accountability, which I thought was pretty interesting and I think you have your own unique take on it. So the first tweet on accountability was, \u201cEmbrace accountability and take business risks under your own name. Society will reward you with responsibility, equity, and leverage.\u201d\nNaval: Yeah. So to get rich, you\u2019re going to need leverage. Leverage comes in labor, comes in capital, or it can come through code or media. But most of these, like labor and capital, people have to give to you. For labor, somebody has to follow you. For capital, somebody has to give you money or assets to manage or machines.\nSo to get these things, you have to build up credibility and you have to do those under your own name as much as possible, which is risky. So accountability is a double-edged thing. It allows you to take credit when things go well and to bear the brunt of the failure when things go badly.\nTake business risks under your own name\nSo in that sense, people who are stamping their names on things aren\u2019t foolish. They\u2019re just confident. Maybe it turns out to be foolish in the end, but if you look at a Kanye or an Oprah or a Trump or an Elon or anyone like that, these people can get rich just off their name because their name is such powerful branding.\nRegardless of what you think of Trump, you have to realize that the guy was among the best in the world at just branding his name. Why would you go to Trump Casino? Used to be because Trump. Why would you go to a Trump tower? Because of Trump.\nWhen it came time to vote, I think that a lot of voters just went in and said, \u201cTrump.\u201d They recognize the name, so the name recognition paid off.\nSame thing with Oprah. She puts her brand on something, her name on something and it flies off the shelves, and it\u2019s like an instant validator.\nThese people also take risks for putting their name out there. Obviously Trump is now probably hated by half or more than half of the country and by a big chunk of the world as he sticks his name out there.\nBy putting your name out there, you become a celebrity, and fame has many, many downsides. It\u2019s better to be anonymous and rich than to be poor and famous, but even famous and rich has a lot of downsides associated with it. You\u2019re always in the public eye.\nA well-functioning team has clear accountability for each position\nAccountability is quite important, and when you\u2019re working to build a product or you\u2019re working in a team or you\u2019re working in a business, we constantly have drummed into our heads how important it is to be part of a team. Absolutely agree with that.\nA lot of our training socially is telling us to not stick our necks out of the crowd. There\u2019s a saying that I hear from our Australian friends that the tall poppy gets cut. Don\u2019t stick your neck out, but I would say that actually a really, really well-functioning team is small and has clear accountability for each of the different portions.\nYou can say, \u201cOkay, this person\u2019s responsible for building the product. This person\u2019s responsible for the messaging. This person\u2019s responsible for raising money. This person\u2019s responsible for the pricing strategy and maybe the online advertising.\u201d So if somebody screws up, you know exactly who\u2019s responsible. While at the same time if something goes really well, you also know exactly who\u2019s responsible.\nIf you have a small team and you have clearly delineated responsibilities, then you can still keep a very high level of accountability. Accountability is really important because when something succeeds or fails, if it fails, everybody points fingers at each other, and if it succeeds, everybody steps forward to take credit.\nWe\u2019ve all had that experience when we were in school and we got a group assignment to do. There were probably a few people in there who did a lot of the work. Then there are a few people who just did a lot of grandstanding or positioning to do the work. We\u2019re all familiar with this from a childhood sense, but it\u2019s sort of uncomfortable to talk about.\nPeople who can fail in public have a lot of power\nClear accountability is important. Without accountability, you don\u2019t have incentives. Without accountability, you can\u2019t build credibility. But you take risk. You take risk of failure. You take risk of humiliation. You take risk of failure under your own name.\nLuckily in modern society, there\u2019s no more debtors\u2019 prison and people don\u2019t go to jail or get executed for losing other people\u2019s money, but we\u2019re still socially hard wired to not fail in public under our own names. The people who have the ability to fail in public under their own names actually gain a lot of power .\nFor example, I\u2019ll give a personal anecdote. Up until about 2013, 2014, my public persona was an entirely around startups and investing. Only around 2014, 2015 did I start talking about philosophy and psychological things and broader things.\nIt made me a little nervous because I was doing it under my own name. There were definitely people in the industry who sent me messages through the back channel like, \u201cWhat are you doing? You\u2019re ending your career. This is stupid.\u201d\nI kind of just went with it. I took a risk. Same with crypto. Early on, I took a risk.\nBut when you put your name out there, you take a risk with certain things. You also get to reap the rewards. You get the benefits.\nTake Accountability to Earn Equity\nIf you have high accountability, you\u2019re less replaceable\nAccountability is how you\u2019re going to get equity\nNaval: Accountability is important because that\u2019s how you\u2019re going to get leverage. That\u2019s how you\u2019re going to get credibility. It\u2019s also how you\u2019re going to get equity. You\u2019re going to get a piece of the business.\nWhen you\u2019re negotiating with other people, ultimately if someone else is making a decision about how to compensate you, that decision will be based on how replaceable you are. If you have high accountability, that makes you less replaceable. Then they have to give you equity, which is a piece of the upside.\nTaking accountability is like taking equity in all your work\nEquity itself is a good example because equity is also a risk-based instrument. Equity means you get paid everything after all the people who need guaranteed money are paid back.\nIf you look at the hierarchy of capital in a company, the employees get paid first. They get paid the salary first. In legal [bankruptcy] proceedings, the salaries are sacrosanct. If you\u2019re a board member and the company spends too much money and has back salaries to pay, the government can go after you personally to pay back the salaries. The employees get the most security, but in exchange for that security, they don\u2019t have as much upside.\nNext in line would be the debt holders who are maybe the bankers who lend money to the company for operations and they need to make their fixed coupon every month or every year, but they don\u2019t get much more upside beyond that. They might be making 5, 10, 15, 20, 25% a year, but that\u2019s what their upside is limited to.\nFinally there are the equity holders. These people are actually going to get most of the upside. Once the debt holders are paid off and the salaries are paid off, whatever remains goes to them.\nBut if there isn\u2019t enough money to pay off the salaries and the debt holders, or if there\u2019s just barely enough to pay off the salary and the debt holders, which is what happens with most businesses, most of the times, the equity holders get nothing.\nThe equity holders take on greater risk, but in exchange, they get nearly unlimited upside. You can do the same with all of your work. Essentially, taking accountability for your actions is the same as taking an equity position in all of your work. You\u2019re taking greater downside risk for greater upside.\nRealize that in modern society, the downside risk is not that large. Even personal bankruptcy can wipe the debts clean in good ecosystems. I\u2019m most familiar with Silicon Valley, but generally people will forgive failures as long as you were honest and made a high integrity effort.\nThere\u2019s not really that much to fear in terms of failure, and so people should be taking on a lot more accountability than they actually are.\nNivi: Is accountability actually fragile or do you really just mean that we\u2019re hardwired not to fail in public, so it just feels like it\u2019s a fragile thing?\nNaval: I think it could actually be fragile. An example of accountability is you\u2019re an airplane pilot. As a captain, you\u2019re taking on accountability for the entire plane.\nLet\u2019s say that something goes wrong with the aircraft. You can\u2019t later blame it on anyone else. You can\u2019t blame it on the steward or the stewardess. You can\u2019t blame it on the copilot. You\u2019re the captain. You\u2019re responsible for the ship. If you screw up, you crash the ship, and there are immediate consequences.\nIn the old days, the captain was expected to go down with the ship. If the ship was sinking, then literally the last person who got to get off was the captain. I think accountability does come with real risks, but we\u2019re talking about a business context.\nThe risk here would be that you would probably be the last one to get your capital back out. You\u2019d be the last one to get paid for your time. The time that you\u2019ve put in, the capital that you\u2019ve put into the company, these are what are at risk.\nEven if a business fails and your name\u2019s on it, that\u2019s not as bad as if it turns out to be an integrity issue. Bernie Madoff, for example, Madoff investments, that name is never going to be good again in the investment community. You could be Bernie Madoff\u2019s great-great-great-grandson. You are not going to go into the investment business because he ruined the family name.\nI think these days the accountability risk with a name happens more around integrity, rather than it does around purely economic failure.\nAccountability is reputational skin in the game\nNivi: The big takeaway for me on accountability is that you will be rewarded directly in proportion with your accountability. I also think this is why people like Taleb rail against CEOs who get rewards without accountability.\nNaval: Yeah. Taleb\u2019s Skin In The Game is required reading. If you want to get anywhere in modern life and understand how modern systems work, then Skin In The Game would be near the top of my list to read.\nAccountability, skin in the game, these concepts go very closely hand in hand. I think of accountability as reputational skin in the game. It\u2019s putting your personal reputation on the line as skin in the game.\nAccountability is a simple concept. The only part of accountability that may be a little counterintuitive is that we\u2019re currently socially brainwashed to not take on accountability, not in a visible way.\nI think there are ways to take on accountability where every member of a team can take on accountability for their portion. That is how you get a well-functioning team while still putting credits and losses in the correct columns.\nLabor and Capital Are Old Leverage\nEveryone is fighting over labor and capital\nOur brains aren\u2019t evolved to comprehend new forms of leverage\nNivi: Why don\u2019t we talk a little bit about leverage?\nThe first tweet in the storm was a famous quote from Archimedes, which was, \u201cGive me a lever long enough and a place to stand and I will move the Earth.\u201d\nThe next tweet was, \u201cFortunes require leverage. Business leverage comes from capital, people and products with no marginal costs of replication.\u201d\nNaval: Leverage is critical. The reason I stuck in Archimedes quote in there is\u2026 normally I don\u2019t like putting other people\u2019s quotes in my Twitter. That doesn\u2019t add any value. You can go look up those people\u2019s quotes. But this quote I had to put in there because it\u2019s just so fundamental. I read it when I was very, very young and it had a huge impression on me.\nWe all know what leverage is when we use a seesaw or a lever. We understand how that works physically, but I think what our brains aren\u2019t really well-evolved to comprehend is how much leverage is possible in modern society and what the newest forms of leverage are.\nSociety overvalues labor leverage\nThe oldest form of leverage is labor, which is people working for you. Instead of me lifting rocks, I can have 10 people lift rocks. Then just by my guidance on where the rock should go, a lot more rocks get moved than I could do myself. Everybody understands this because we\u2019re evolved to understand the labor form of leverage, so what happens is society overvalues labor as a form of leverage.\nThis is why your parents are impressed when you get a promotion and you have lots of people working underneath you. This is why when a lot of naive people, when you tell them about your company, they\u2019ll say, \u201cHow many people work there?\u201d They\u2019ll use that as a way to establish credibility. They\u2019re trying to measure how much leverage and impact you actually have.\nOr when someone starts a movement, they\u2019ll say how many people they have or how big the army is. We just automatically assume that more people is better.\nYou want the minimum amount of labor that allows you to use the other forms of leverage\nI would argue that this is the worst form of leverage that you could possibly use. Managing other people is incredibly messy. It requires tremendous leadership skills. You\u2019re one short hop from a mutiny or getting eaten or torn apart by the mob.\nIt\u2019s incredibly competed over. Entire civilizations have been destroyed over this fight. For example, communism, Marxism, is all about the battle between capital and labor, das kapital and das labor. It\u2019s kind of a trap.\nYou really want to stay out of labor-based leverage. You want the minimum amount of people working with you that are going to allow you to use the other forms of leverage, which I would argue are much more interesting.\nCapital has been the dominant form of leverage in the last century\nThe second type of leverage is capital. This one\u2019s a little less hardwired into us because large amounts of money moving around and being saved and being invested in money markets, these are inventions of human beings the in last few hundred to few thousand years. They\u2019re not evolved with us from hundreds of thousands of years.\nWe understand them a little bit less well. They probably require more intelligence to use correctly, and the ways in which we use them keep changing. Management skills from a hundred years ago might still apply today, but investing in the stock market skills from a hundred years ago probably don\u2019t apply to the same level today.\nCapital is a trickier form of leverage to use. It\u2019s more modern. It\u2019s the one that people have used to get fabulously wealthy in the last century. It\u2019s probably been the dominant form of leverage in the last century.\nYou can see this by who are the richest people. It\u2019s bankers, politicians in corrupt countries who print money, essentially people who move large amounts of money around.\nIf you look at the top of very large companies, outside of technology companies, in many, many large old companies, the CEO job is really a financial job. They\u2019re really financial asset managers. Sometimes, an asset manager can put a pleasant face on it, so you get a Warren Buffet type.\nBut deep down, I think we all dislike capital as a form of leverage because it feels unfair. It\u2019s this invisible thing that can be accumulated and passed across generations and suddenly seems to result in people having gargantuan amounts of money with nobody else around them or necessarily sharing in it.\nThat said, capital is a powerful form of leverage. It can be converted to labor. It can be converted to other things. It\u2019s very surgical, very analytical.\nIf you are a brilliant investor and give $1 billion and you can make a 30% return with it, whereas anybody else can only make a 20% return, you\u2019re going to get all the money and you\u2019re going to get paid very handsomely for it.\nIt scales very, very well. If you get good at managing capital, you can manage more and more capital much more easily than you can manage more and more people.\nYou need specific knowledge and accountability to obtain capital\nIt is a good form of leverage, but the hard part with capital is how do you obtain it? That\u2019s why I talked about specific knowledge and accountability first.\nIf you have specific knowledge in a domain and if you\u2019re accountable and you have a good name in that domain, then people are going to give you capital as a form of leverage that you can use to then go get more capital.\nCapital also is fairly well understood. I think a lot of the knocks against capitalism come because of the accumulation of capital.\nProduct and Media Are New Leverage\nCreate software and media that work for you while you sleep\nProduct and media are the new leverage\nNaval: The most interesting and the most important form of leverage is this idea of products that have no marginal cost of replication. This is the new form of leverage.\nThis was only invented in the last few hundred years. It got started with the printing press. It accelerated with broadcast media, and now it\u2019s really blown up with the Internet and with coding.\nNow, you can multiply your efforts without having to involve other humans and without needing money from other humans.\nThis podcast is a form of leverage. Long ago, I would have had to sit in a lecture hall and lecture each of you personally. I would have maybe reached a few hundred people and that would have been that.\nThen 40 years ago, 30 years ago, I would have to be lucky to get on TV, which is somebody else\u2019s leverage. They would have distorted the message. They would taken the economics out of it or charged me for it. They would have muddled the message, and I would have been lucky to get that form of leverage.\nToday, thanks to the Internet, I can buy a cheap microphone, hook it up to a laptop or an iPad, and there you are all listening.\nProduct leverage is where the new fortunes are made\nThis newest form of leverage is where all the new fortunes are made, all the new billionaires. The last generation, fortunes were made by capital. That was the Warren Buffets of the world.\nBut the new generation\u2019s fortunes are all made through code or media. Joe Rogan making 50 to a 100 million bucks a year from his podcast. You\u2019re going to have a PewDiePie. I don\u2019t know how much money he\u2019s rolling in, but he\u2019s bigger than the news. The Fortnite players. Of course Jeff Bezos and Mark Zuckerberg and Larry Page and Sergey Brin and Bill Gates and Steve Jobs. That is all code-based leverage.\nCombining all three forms of leverage is a magic combination\nNow, the beauty is when you combine all of these three. That\u2019s where tech startups really excel, where you take just the minimum, but highest output labor that you can get, which are engineers, and designers, product developers. Then you add in capital. You use that for marketing, advertising, scaling. You add in lots of code and media and podcasts and content to get it all out there.\nThat is a magic combination, and that\u2019s why you see technology startups explode out of nowhere, use massive leverage and just make huge outsize returns.\nProduct and media leverage are permissionless\nNivi: Do you want to talk a little bit about permissioned versus permissionless?\nNaval: Probably the most interesting thing to keep in mind about the new forms of leverage is they are permissionless. They don\u2019t require somebody else\u2019s permission for you to use them or succeed.\nFor labor leverage, somebody has to decide to follow you. For capital leverage, somebody has to give you money to invest or to turn into a product.\nCoding, writing books, recording podcasts, tweeting, YouTubing, these kinds of things, these are permissionless. You don\u2019t need anyone\u2019s permission to do them, and that\u2019s why they are very egalitarian. They\u2019re great equalizers of leverage.\nAs much as people may rail on Facebook and YouTube, they\u2019re not going to stop using it because this permissionless leverage, where everyone can be a broadcaster, is just too good.\nThe same way you can rail upon Apple for having a slightly closed ecosystem in the iPhone, but everyone\u2019s writing apps for it. As long as you can write apps for it, you can get rich or reach users doing that, why not?\nThe robot army is already here\u2014code lets you tell them what to do\nI think of all the forms of leverage, the best one in modern society \u2026 This is glib. This is a little overused. This is why I tell people learn to code. It\u2019s that we have this idea that in the future there\u2019s going to be these robots and they\u2019re going to be doing everything.\nThat may be true, but I would say that the majority of the robot revolution has already happened. The robots are already here and there are way more robots than there are humans, it\u2019s just that we pack them in data centers for heat and efficiency reasons. We put them in servers. They\u2019re inside the computers. All the circuits, it\u2019s robot minds inside that\u2019s doing all the work.\nEvery great software developer, for example, now has an army of robots working for him at nighttime, while he or she sleeps, after they\u2019ve written the code and it\u2019s just cranking away.\nThe robot army is already here. The robot revolution has already happened. We\u2019re about halfway through it. We\u2019re just adding in much more of the hardware component these days as we get more comfortable with the idea of autonomous vehicles and autonomous airplanes and autonomous ships and maybe autonomous trucks. There\u2019re delivery bots and Boston Dynamics robots and all that.\nBut robots who are doing web searching for you, for example, are already here. The ones who are cleaning up your video and audio and transmitting it around the world are already here. The ones who are answering many customer service queries, things that you would have had to call a human for are already here.\nAn army of robots is already here. It\u2019s very cheaply available. The bottleneck is just figuring out intelligent and interesting things to do to them.\nEssentially you can order this army of robots around. The commands have to be issued in a computer language, in a language that they understand.\nThese robots aren\u2019t very smart. They have to be told very precisely what to do and how to do it. Coding is such a great superpower because now you can speak the language of the robot armies and you can tell them what to do.\nNivi: I think at this point, people are not only commanding the army of robots within servers through code, they\u2019re actually manipulating the movement of trucks, of other people. Just ordering a package on Amazon, you\u2019re manipulating the movement of many people and many robots to get a package delivered to you.\nPeople are doing the same things to build businesses now. There\u2019s the army of robots within servers and then there\u2019s also an army of actual robots and people that are being manipulated through software.\nProduct Leverage is Egalitarian\nThe best products tend to be available to everyone\nProduct leverage is a positive-sum game\nNaval: Labor and capital are much less egalitarian, not just in the inputs, but in their outputs.\nLet\u2019s say that I need something that humans have to provide like if I want a massage or if I need someone to cook my food. The more of a human element there is in providing that service, the less egalitarian it is. Jeff Bezos probably has much better vacations than most of us because he has lots of humans running around doing whatever he needs to do.\nIf you look at the output of code and media, Jeff Bezos doesn\u2019t get to watch better movies and TV than we do. Jeff Bezos doesn\u2019t get to even have better computing experience. Google doesn\u2019t give him some premium, special Google account where his searches are better.\nIt\u2019s the nature of code and media output that the same product is accessible to everybody. It turns into a positive sum game where if Jeff Bezos is consuming the same product as a thousand other people, that product is going to be better than the version that Jeff would consume on his own.\nStatus goods are limited to a few people\nWhereas with other products, that\u2019s not true. If you look at something like buying a Rolex, which is no longer about telling time. It\u2019s a signaling good. It\u2019s all about showing off, \u201cI have a Rolex.\u201d That\u2019s a zero-sum game.\nIf everybody in the world is wearing a Rolex, then people don\u2019t want to wear Rolexes anymore because they no longer signal. It\u2019s canceled out the effect.\nRich people do have an advantage in consuming that product. They\u2019ll just price it up until only they can have Rolexes. Then poor people can\u2019t have Rolexes and Rolexes resume their signaling value.\nThe best products tend to be targeted at the middle class\nSomething like watching Netflix or using Google or using Facebook or YouTube or even frankly modern day cars. Rich people don\u2019t have better cars. They just have weirder cars.\nYou can\u2019t drive a Lamborghini on the street at any speed that makes sense for a Lamborghini, so it\u2019s actually a worse car in the street. It just turned into a signaling good at that point. Your sweet spot, where you want to be, is somewhere like a Tesla Model 3 or like a Toyota Corolla which is an amazing car.\nA new Toyota Corolla is a really nice car, but because it\u2019s mainstream, the technology has amortized the cost of production over the largest number of consumers possible.\nThe best products tend to be at the center, at the sweet spot, the middle class, rather than being targeted at the upper class.\nCreating wealth with product leads to more ethical wealth\nI think one of the things that we don\u2019t necessarily appreciate in modern societies is as the forms of leverage have gone from being human-based, labor-based and being capital-based to being more product and code and media-based, that most of the goods and services that we consume are becoming much more egalitarian in their consumption.\nEven food is becoming that way. Food is becoming cheap and abundant, at least in the first world, too much so to our detriment. Jeff Bezos isn\u2019t necessarily eating better food. He\u2019s just eating different food or he\u2019s eating food that\u2019s prepared and served theatrically, so it\u2019s almost like more of again the human element of performance.\nBut the labor element out of food production has gone down massively. The capital element has gone down massively. Even food production itself has become more technology-oriented, and so the gap between the haves and the have-nots is getting smaller.\nIf you care about ethics in wealth creation, it is better to create your wealth using code and media as leverage because then those products are equally available to everybody as opposed to trying to create your wealth through labor or capital.\nYou want to use the product that is used by the most people\nWhat I\u2019m referring to here is scale economies. Technology products and media products have such amazing scale economies that you always want to use the product that is used by the most people. The one that\u2019s used by the most people ends up having the largest budget. There\u2019s no marginal cost of adding another user, and so with the largest budget, you get the highest quality.\nThe best TV shows are actually not going to be some obscure ones just made for a few rich people. They\u2019re going to be the big budget ones, like the Game of Thrones or the Breaking Bad or Bird Box, where they have massive, massive budgets. They can just use those budgets to get to a certain quality level.\nThen rich people, to be different, they have to fly to Sundance and watch a documentary. You and I aren\u2019t going to fly to Sundance because that\u2019s something that bored rich people do to show off. We\u2019re not going to watch a documentary because most of them just aren\u2019t actually even that good.\nAgain, if you\u2019re wealthy today, for large classes of things, you spend your money on signaling goods to show other people that you\u2019re wealthy, then you try and convert them to status. As opposed to actually consuming the goods for their own sake.\nNivi: People and capital as a form of leverage have a negative externality and code and product have a positive externality attached to them, if I was going to sum up your point.\nCapital and labor are becoming permissionless\nI think that capital and labor are also starting to become a little more permissionless or at least the permissioning is diffuse because of the Internet. Instead of labor, we have community now, which is a diffused form of labor. For example, Mark Zuckerberg has a billion people doing work for him by using Facebook.\nInstead of going to raise capital from someone who\u2019s rich, now we have crowdfunding. You can raise millions and millions of dollars for a charity, for a health problem or for a business. You can do it all online.\nCapital and labor are also becoming permissionless, and you don\u2019t need to necessarily do it the old fashioned way, where you have to go around and ask people for permission to use their money or their time.\nPick a Business Model with Leverage\nAn ideal business model has network effects, low marginal costs and scale economies\nScale economies: the more you produce, the cheaper it gets\nNivi: One more question about leverage. Do you think a choice of business model or a choice of product can also bring a kind of leverage to it?\nFor example, pursuing a business that has network effects. Pursuing a business that has brand effects. Or other choices of business model that people could manipulate that just give you free leverage.\nNaval: Yeah, there\u2019s some really good microeconomic concepts that are important to understand.\nOne of those is scale economies, which is the more you produce of something the cheaper it gets to make it. That\u2019s something that a lot of businesses have, Basic Economics 101.\nYou should try and get into a business where making Widget Number 12 is cheaper than making Widget Number 5, and making Widget Number 10,000 is a lot cheaper than the previous ones. This builds up an automatic barrier to entry against competition and getting commoditized. That\u2019s an important one.\nZero marginal cost of reproduction: producing more is free\nAnother one is, and this is along the same lines, but technology products especially, and media products, have this great quality where they have zero marginal cost of reproduction. Creating another copy of what you just created is free.\nWhen somebody listens to this podcast or watches a YouTube video about this, it doesn\u2019t cost me anything for the next person who shows up. Those zero marginal cost things, they take a while to get going because you make very little money per user, but over time they can really, really add up.\nJoe Rogan is working no harder on his current podcast than he was on Podcast number 1, but on Podcast number 1,100 he\u2019s making a million dollars from the podcast whereas for the previous one he probably lost money; for the first one. That\u2019s an example of zero marginal cost.\nNetwork effects: value grows as the square of the customers\nThen, the most subtle but the most important is this idea of network effects. It comes from computer networking. Bob Metcalfe, who created Ethernet, famously coined Metcalfe\u2019s Law, which is the value of a network is proportional to the square of the number of nodes in the network.\nIf a network of size 10 would have a value of a 100, a network of a size 100 would have a value of 10,000. It\u2019s not just 10 times more, it\u2019s 100 times more, because of the square; the difference is the square.\nYou want to be in a network effects business, assuming you\u2019re not number two. If you\u2019re number one in network effect business, you win everything. Example: if you look at Facebook, your friends and family social networking protocol. Who\u2019s their competitor? Nobody, because they won everything through network effects. Which is why when people say, \u201cWell, I can just switch away from Facebook,\u201d they don\u2019t realize that network effects create natural monopolies. They\u2019re very, very powerful things.\nNetwork effect businesses are natural monopolies\nOne of the dirty secrets of Silicon Valley is that a lot of the winning businesses are natural monopolies. Even ride-sharing tends towards one winner-take-all system.\nUber will always have better economics than Lyft, as long as it\u2019s moving more drivers and more riders around. Something like Google, there\u2019s basically only one viable search engine. I do like DuckDuckGo, privacy reasons, but they\u2019re just always gonna be behind because of network effects. Twitter: where else would you go for microblogging? Even YouTube has weak network effects, but they\u2019re still powerful enough that there\u2019s really no number two site that you go to, to consume your video on a regular basis. It even turns out in e-tail, Amazon Prime and kind of the convenience of stored credit cards and information creates a powerful network effect.\nIn a network effect, each new user adds value to the existing users\nWhat is a network effect? Let\u2019s just define it precisely. A network effect is when each additional user adds value to the existing user base. Your users themselves are creating some value for the existing users.\nThe classic example that I think everybody can understand is, language. Let\u2019s say that there\u2019s 100 people living in the community and speak 10 different languages, and each person just speaks one of those 10. Well, you\u2019re having to translate all the time; it\u2019s incredibly painful. But if all 100 of you spoke the same language, it would add tremendous value.\nThe way that community will play out is, 10 people start off speaking 10 languages, and let\u2019s say one extra person learns English. Well, now all of a sudden, 11 people know English, so the next person comes in to learn a new language is probably going to chose English. At some point, let\u2019s say English gets to 20 or 25 people, it\u2019s done. It\u2019s just going to own the entire language marketplace, and the rest of the languages will get competed out.\nWhich is why, long-term, the entire world is probably going to end up speaking English and Chinese. China\u2019s closed off on the Internet, but the Internet itself is a great leveler, and people who want to communicate on the Internet are forced to speak English because the largest community of people on the Internet speaks English.\nI always feel bad for my colleagues who grew up speaking foreign languages in foreign countries, because you don\u2019t have access to so many books; so many books just haven\u2019t been translated into other languages. If you only spoke French, or you only spoke German, or you only spoke Hindi, for example, you would be at a severe disadvantage in a technical education.\nInvariably, if you go and get a technical education, you have to learn English just because you have to read these books that have this data that has not been translated. Languages are probably the oldest example of network effect.\nMoney is another example. We should all probably be using the same money, except for the fact that geographic and regulatory boundaries have created these artificial islands of money. But even then, the world tends to use a single currency as the reserve currency at most times; currently, the US dollar.\nZero marginal cost businesses can pivot into network effect businesses\nNetwork effects are a very powerful concept, and when you\u2019re picking a business model, it\u2019s a really good idea to pick a model where you can benefit from network effects, low marginal costs, and scale economies; and these tend to go together.\nAnything that has zero marginal costs of production obviously has scale economies, and things that have zero marginal costs of reproduction very often tend to have network effects, because it doesn\u2019t cost you anything more to stamp out the thing. So then you can just create little hooks for users to add value to each other.\nYou should always be thinking about how your users, your customers, can add value to each other because that is the ultimate form of leverage. You\u2019re at the beach in the Bahamas or you\u2019re sleeping at night and your customers are adding value to each other.\nExample: From Laborer to Entrepreneur\nFrom low to high specific knowledge, accountability and leverage\nLaborers get paid hourly and have low accountability\nNaval: The tweetstorm is very abstract. It\u2019s deliberately meant to be broadly applicable to all kinds of different domains and disciplines and time periods and places. But sometimes it\u2019s hard to work without a concrete example. So let\u2019s go concrete for a minute.\nLook at the real estate business. You could start at the bottom, let\u2019s say you\u2019re a day laborer. You come in, you fix people\u2019s houses. Someone orders you around, tells you, \u201cBreak that piece of rock. Sand that piece of wood. Put that thing over there.\u201d\nThere\u2019s just all these menial jobs that go on, on a construction site. If you\u2019re working one of those jobs, unless you\u2019re a skilled trade, say, a carpenter or electrician, you don\u2019t really have specific knowledge.\nEven a carpenter or an electrician is not that specific because other people can be trained how to do it. You can be replaced. You get paid your $15, $20, $25, $50, if you\u2019re really lucky, $75 an hour, but that\u2019s about it.\nYou don\u2019t have any leverage other than from the tools that you\u2019re using. If you\u2019re driving a bulldozer that\u2019s better than doing it with your hands. A day laborer in India makes a lot less because they have no tool leverage.\nYou don\u2019t have much accountability. You\u2019re a faceless cog in a construction crew and the owner of the house or the buyer of the house doesn\u2019t know or care that you worked on it.\nGeneral contractors get equity, but they\u2019re also taking risk\nOne step up from that, you might have a contractor, like a general contractor who someone hires to come and fix and repair and build up their house. That general contractor is taking accountability; they\u2019re taking responsibility.\nNow let\u2019s say they got paid $250,000 for the job. Sorry, I\u2019m using Bay Area prices, so maybe I\u2019ll go rest of the world prices, $100,000 for the job to fix up a house, and it actually costs the general contractor, all said and done, $70,000. That contractor\u2019s going to pocket that remaining $30,000.\nThey got the upside. They got the equity but they\u2019re also taking accountability and risk. If the project runs over and there\u2019s losses, then they eat the losses. But you see, just the accountability gives them some form of additional potential income.\nThen, they also have labor leverage because they have a bunch of people working for them. But it probably tops out right there.\nProperty developers pocket the profit by applying capital leverage\nYou can go one level above that and you can look at a property developer. This might be someone who is a contractor who did a bunch of houses, did a really good job, then decided to go into business for themselves and they go around looking for beaten down properties that have potential.\nThey buy them, they either raise money from investors or front it themselves, they fix the place up, and then they sell it for twice what they bought it for. Maybe they only put in 20% more, so it\u2019s a healthy profit.\nSo now a developer like that takes on more accountability, has more risk. They have more specific knowledge because now you have to know: which neighborhoods are worth buying in. Which lots are actually good or which lots are bad. What makes or breaks a specific property. You have to imagine the finished house that\u2019s going to be there, even when the property itself might look really bad right now.\nThere\u2019s more specific knowledge, there\u2019s more accountability and risk, and now you also have capital leverage because you\u2019re also putting in money into the project. But conceivably, you could buy a piece of land or a broken-down house for $200,000 and turn it into a million dollar mansion and pocket all the difference.\nArchitects, large developers and REITs are even higher in the stack\nOne level beyond that might be a famous architect or a developer, where just having your name on a property, because you\u2019ve done so many great properties, increases its value.\nOne level up from that, you might be a person who decides, well, I understand real estate, and I now know enough of the dynamics of real estate that rather than just build and flip my own properties or improve my own properties, I\u2019m gonna be a massive developer. I\u2019m going to build entire communities.\nNow another person might say, \u201cI like that leverage, but I don\u2019t want to manage all these people. I want to do it more through capital. So I\u2019m gonna start a real estate investment trust.\u201d That requires specific knowledge not just about investing in real estate and building real estate, but it also requires specific knowledge about the financial markets, and the capital markets, and how real estate trusts operate.\nReal estate tech companies apply the maximum leverage\nOne level beyond that might be somebody who says, \u201cActually, I want to bring the maximum leverage to bear in this market, and the maximum specific knowledge.\u201d That person would say, \u201cWell, I understand real estate, and I understand everything from basic housing construction, to building properties and selling them, to how real estate markets move and thrive, and I also understand the technology business. I understand how to recruit developers, how to write code and how to build good product, and I understand how to raise money from venture capitalists and how to return it and how all of that works.\u201d\nObviously not a single person may know this. You may pull a team together to do it where each have different skill sets, but that combined entity would have specific knowledge in technology and in real estate.\nIt would have massive accountability because that company\u2019s name would be a very high risk, high reward effort attached to the whole thing, and people would devote their lives to it and take on significant risk.\nIt would have leverage in code with lots of developers. It would have capital with investors putting money in and the founder\u2019s own capital. It would have labor of some of the highest quality labor that you can find, which is high quality engineers and designers and marketers who are working on the company.\nThen you may end up with a Trulia or a RedFin or a Zillow kind of company, and then the upside could potentially be in the billions of dollars, or the hundreds of millions of dollars.\nAs you layer in more and more kinds of knowledge that can only be gained on the job and aren\u2019t common knowledge, and you layer in more and more accountability and risk-taking, and you layer in more and more great people working on it and more and more capital on it, and more and more code and media on it, you keep expanding the scope of the opportunity all the way from the day-laborer, who might just literally be scrappling on the ground with their hands, all the way up to somebody who started a real estate tech company and then took it public.\nJudgment Is the Decisive Skill\nIn an age of nearly infinite leverage, judgment is the most important skill\nIn an age of infinite leverage, judgment becomes the most important skill\nNivi: We spoke about specific knowledge, we talked about accountability, we talked about leverage. The last skill that Naval talks about in his tweetstorm is judgment, where he says, that \u201cLeverage is a force multiplier for your judgment.\u201d\nNaval: We are now living in an age of nearly infinite leverage, and all the great fortunes are created through leverage. Your first job is to go and obtain leverage, and you can obtain leverage through permission by getting people to work for you, or by raising capital.\nOr you can get leverage permissionlessly by learning how to code or becoming good communicator and podcasting, broadcasting, creating videos, writing, etc.\nThat\u2019s how you get leverage, but once you have leverage, what do you do with it? Well, the first part of your career\u2019s spent hustling to get leverage. Once you have the leverage, then you wanna slow down a bit, because your judgment really matters.\nIt\u2019s like you\u2019ve gone from steering your sailboat around to now you\u2019re steering an ocean liner or a tanker. You have a lot more at risk, but you have a lot more to gain as well. You\u2019re carrying a much higher payload. In an age of infinite leverage, judgment becomes the most important skill.\nWarren Buffett is so wealthy now because of his judgment. Even if you were to take away all of Warren\u2019s money, tomorrow, investors would come out of the woodwork and hand him a $100 billion because they know his judgment is so good, and they would give him a big chunk of that $100 billion to invest.\nEverything else you do is setting you up to apply judgment\nUltimately, everything else that you do is actually setting you up to apply your judgment. One of the big things that people rail on is CEO pay. For sure there\u2019s crony capitalism that goes on where these CEOs control their boards and the boards give them too much money.\nBut, there are certain CEOs who definitely earned their keep because their judgment is better. If you\u2019re steering a big ship, if you\u2019re steering Google or Apple, and your judgment is 10 or 20 percent better than the next person\u2019s, society will literally pay you hundreds of millions of dollars more, because you\u2019re steering a $100 billion ship.\nIf you\u2019re on course 10 or 20 percent of the time more often than the other person, the compounding results on that hundreds of billions of dollars you\u2019re managing will be so large that your CEO pay will be dwarfed in comparison.\nDemonstrated judgment, credibility around the judgment, is so critical. Warren Buffett wins here because he has massive credibility. He\u2019s been highly accountable. He\u2019s been right over and over in the public domain. He\u2019s built a reputation for very high integrity, so you can trust him.\nA person like that, people will throw infinite leverage behind him because of his judgment. Nobody asks him how hard he works; nobody asks him when he wakes up or when he goes to sleep. They\u2019re like, \u201cWarren, just do your thing.\u201d\nJudgment, especially demonstrated judgment, with high accountability, clear track record, is critical.\nJudgment is knowing the long-term consequences of your actions\nNivi: Let\u2019s define judgment. I would define it as knowing the long-term effects of your decisions, or being able to predict the long-term effects of your decisions.\nNaval: It\u2019s funny. My definition of wisdom is knowing the long term consequences of your actions, so they\u2019re not all that different. Wisdom is just judgment on a personal domain.\nWisdom applied to external problems I think is judgment. They\u2019re highly linked. But, yes, it\u2019s knowing the long term consequences of your actions and then making the right decision to capitalize on that.\nWithout experience, judgment is often less than useless\nJudgment is very hard to build up. This is where both intellect and experience come in play.\nThere are many problems with the so-called intellectuals in the ivory tower, but one of the reasons why Nassim Taleb rails against them is because they have no skin in the game. They have no real-world experience, so they just apply purely intellect.\nIntellect without any experience is often worse than useless because you get the confidence that the intellect gives you, and you get some of the credibility, but because you had no skin in the game, and you had no real experience, and no real accountability, you\u2019re just throwing darts.\nThe real world is always far, far more complex than we can intellectualize. Especially all the interesting, fast-moving edge domains and problems, you can\u2019t get there without experience. If you are smart and you iterate fast, it\u2019s not even you put 10,000 hours into something, but you take 10,000 tries at something.\nThe people with the best judgment are among the least emotional\nIf you are smart and you have a lot of quick iterations, and you try to keep your emotions out of it, the people with the best judgment are actually among the least emotional. A lot of the best investors are considered almost robotic in that regard, but I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if even the best entrepreneurs often come across as unemotional.\nThere is sort of this archetype of the passionate entrepreneur, and yeah, they have to care about what they\u2019re doing, but they also have to see very clearly what\u2019s actually happening. The thing that prevents you from seeing what\u2019s actually happening are your emotions. Our emotions are constantly clouding our judgment, and in investing, or in running companies, or in building products, or being an entrepreneur, emotions really get in the way.\nEmotions are what prevent you from seeing what\u2019s actually happening, until you can no longer resist the truth of what\u2019s happening, until it becomes too sudden, and then you\u2019re forced into suffering; which is sort of a breaking of this fantasy that you had put together.\nNivi: To try and connect some of these concepts, I would say that, first, you\u2019re accountable for your judgment. Judgment is the exercise of wisdom. Wisdom comes from experience; and that experience can be accelerated through short iterations.\nTop investors often sound like philosophers\nNaval: And the reason why a lot of the top investors, a lot of the value investors, like if you read Jeremy Grantham, or you read Warren Buffet, or you read up on Michael Burry, these people sound like philosophers, or they are philosophers, or they\u2019re reading a lot of history books or science books.\nLike what are they doing, shouldn\u2019t they be reading investment books. No. Investment books are the worst place to learn about investment, because investment is a real-world activity that is highly multi-variate, all the advantages are always being competed away. It\u2019s always on the cutting-edge.\nWhat you actually just need is very, very broad-based judgment and thinking. The best way to do that is to study everything, including a lot of philosophy. Philosophy also makes you more stoic, makes you less emotional, and so you make better decisions; you have better judgment.\nThe more outraged someone is, the worse their judgment\nOne simple thing is I see \u2026 I go out on Twitter and it seems like half of Twitter is outraged at something at all times. You can go within someone\u2019s Twitter feed and get at least some semblance of what it must be like to be in their head all the time.\nThe more outraged somebody is, I guarantee you, the worse their judgment is. If someone\u2019s constantly tweeting political outrage, and just see like an angry person getting into fights, you don\u2019t want to hand this person the keys to your car, let alone the keys to your company.\nSet an Aspirational Hourly Rate\nOutsource tasks that cost less than your hourly rate\nSet and enforce an aspirational hourly rate\nNivi: We covered the skills you need to get rich. They included specific knowledge, accountability, leverage, judgment and life-long learning. Let\u2019s talk about the importance of working hard and valuing your time.\nNaval: No one is going to value you more than you value you. Set a high personal hourly rate, and stick to it. When I was young, I decided I was worth a lot more than the market thought I was worth. And I started treating myself that way.\nFactor your time into every decision. Say you value your time at $100 an hour. If you decide to spend an hour driving across town to get something, you\u2019re effectively throwing away $100. Are you going to do that?\nSay you buy something from Amazon and they screw it up. Is it worth your time to return it? Is it worth the mental hassle? Keep in mind that you will have less time for work, including mentally high-output work. Do you want to use that time running errands and solving little problems? Or do you want to save it for the big stuff?\nThe great scientists were terrible at managing their home lives. None of them had an organized room, or made social events on time, or sent their thank-you cards.\nYou can\u2019t penny pinch your way to wealth\nYou can spend your life however you want. But if you want to get rich, it has to be your top priority. It has to come before anything else, which means you can\u2019t penny-pinch. This is what people don\u2019t understand.\nYou can penny-pinch your way to basic sustenance. You can keep expenses low and maybe retire early. That\u2019s perfectly valid. But we\u2019re here to talk about wealth creation. If you\u2019re going to create wealth, it has to be your number-one, overwhelming priority.\nMy aspirational rate was $5,000/hr\nFast-forward to your wealthy self and pick an intermediate hourly rate. Before I had any real money and you could hire me, I set an aspirational rate of $5,000 an hour.\nOf course, I still ended up doing stupid things like arguing with the electrician or returning the broken speaker. But I shouldn\u2019t have. And I did a lot less of it my friends. I would make a theatrical show out of throwing something in the trash or giving it to Salvation Army, rather than returning it or trying to fix it.\nI would argue with girlfriends, \u201cI don\u2019t do that. That\u2019s not a problem that I solve.\u201d I still argue that today with my wife and with my mother, when she hands me little to-do\u2019s. I say, \u201cI would rather hire you an assistant.\u201d This was true even when I didn\u2019t have money.\nIf you can outsource something for less than your hourly rate, do it\nAnother way to think about this: If you can outsource something\u2014or not do something\u2014for less than your hourly rate, outsource it or don\u2019t do it. If you can hire someone to do it for less than your hourly rate, hire them. That includes things like cooking. You may want to make your own healthy, home-cooked meals. But if you can outsource it, do that instead.\nPeople say, \u201cWhat about the joy of life? What about getting it right, just your way?\u201d Sure, you can do that. But you\u2019re not going to be wealthy, because you\u2019ve made something else a priority.\nPaul Graham said it well for Y Combinator startups. He said you should be working on your product and getting product-market fit, and you should be exercising and eating healthy. That\u2019s about it. That\u2019s all you have time for while you\u2019re on this mission.\nYour hourly rate should seem absurdly high\nSet a very high aspirational hourly rate for yourself, and stick to it. It should seem and feel absurdly high. If it doesn\u2019t, it\u2019s not high enough. Whatever you pick, my advice is to raise it.\nFor the longest time, I used $5,000 an hour. If you extrapolate that out as an annual salary, it\u2019s multiple millions of dollars per year. I actually think I\u2019ve beaten it, which is interesting given that I\u2019m not the hardest worker. I work through bursts of energy when I\u2019m motivated to work on something.\nWork As Hard As You Can\nEven though what you work on and who you work with are more important\nWork as hard as you can\nNaval: Let\u2019s talk about hard work. There\u2019s a battle that happens on Twitter a lot. Should you work hard or should you not? David Heinemeier Hansson says, \u201cIt\u2019s like you\u2019re slave-driving people.\u201d Keith Rabois says, \u201cNo, all the great founders worked their fingers to the bone.\u201d\nThey\u2019re talking past each other.\nFirst of all, they\u2019re talking about two different things. David is talking about employees and a lifestyle business. If you\u2019re doing that, your number one priority is not getting wealthy. You have a job, a family and also your life.\nKeith is talking about the Olympics of startups. He\u2019s talking about the person going for the gold medal and trying to build a multi-billion dollar public company. That person has to get everything right. They have to have great judgment. They have to pick the right thing to work on. They have to recruit the right team. They have to work crazy hard. They\u2019re engaged in a competitive sprint.\nIf getting wealthy is your goal, you\u2019re going to have to work as hard as you can. But hard work is no substitute for who you work with and what you work on. Those are the most important things.\nWhat you work on and who you work with are more important\nMarc Andreessen came up with the concept of the \u201cproduct-market fit.\u201d I would expand that to \u201cproduct-market-founder fit,\u201d taking into account how well a founder is personally suited to the business. The combination of the three should be your overwhelming goal.\nYou can save a lot of time by picking the right area to work in. Picking the right people to work with is the next most important piece. Third comes how hard you work. They are like three legs of a stool. If you shortchange any one of them, the whole stool is going to fall. You can\u2019t easily pick one over the other.\nWhen you\u2019re building a business, or a career, first figure out: \u201cWhat should I be doing? Where is a market emerging? What\u2019s a product I can build that I\u2019m excited to work on, where I have specific knowledge?\u201d\nNo matter how high your bar is, raise it\nSecond, surround yourself with the best people possible. If there\u2019s someone greater out there to work with, go work with them. When people ask for advice about choosing the right startup to join, I say, \u201cPick the one that\u2019s going to have the best alumni network for you in the future.\u201d Look at the PayPal mafia\u2014they worked with a bunch of geniuses, so they all got rich. Pick the people with the highest intelligence, energy and integrity that you can find.\nAnd no matter how high your bar is, raise it.\nFinally, once you\u2019ve picked the right thing to work on and the right people, work as hard as you can.\nNobody really works 80 hours a week\nThis is where the mythology gets a little crazy. People who say they work 80-hour weeks, or even 120-hour weeks, often are just status signaling. It\u2019s showing off. Nobody really works 80 to 120 hours a week at high output, with mental clarity. Your brain breaks down. You won\u2019t have good ideas.\nThe way people tend to work most effectively, especially in knowledge work, is to sprint as hard as they can while they feel inspired to work, and then rest. They take long breaks.\nIt\u2019s more like a lion hunting and less like a marathoner running. You sprint and then you rest. You reassess and then you try again. You end up building a marathon of sprints.\nInspiration is perishable\nInspiration is perishable. When you have inspiration, act on it right then and there.\nIf I\u2019m inspired to write a blog post or publish a tweetstorm, I should do it right away. Otherwise, it\u2019s not going to get out there. I won\u2019t come back to it. Inspiration is a beautiful and powerful thing. When you have it, seize it.\nImpatience with actions, patience with results\nPeople talk about impatience. When do you know to be impatient? When do you know to be patient? My glib tweet on this was: \u201cImpatience with actions, patience with results.\u201d I think that\u2019s a good philosophy for life.\nAnything you have to do, get it done. Why wait? You\u2019re not getting any younger.\nYou don\u2019t want to spend your life waiting in line. You don\u2019t want to spend it traveling back and forth. You don\u2019t want to spend it doing things that aren\u2019t part of your mission.\nWhen you do these things, do them as quickly as you can and with your full attention so you do them well. Then be patient with the results because you\u2019re dealing with complex systems and a lot of people.\nIt takes a long time for markets to adopt products. It takes time for people to get comfortable working with each other. It takes time for great products to emerge as you polish away.\nImpatience with actions, patience with results.\nIf I discover a problem in one of my businesses, I won\u2019t sleep until the resolution is at least in motion. If I\u2019m on the board of a company, I\u2019ll call the CEO. If I\u2019m running the company, I\u2019ll call my reports. If I\u2019m responsible, I\u2019ll get on it, right then and there, and solve it.\nIf I don\u2019t solve a problem the moment it happens\u2014or if I don\u2019t move towards solving it\u2014I have no peace. I have no rest. I have no happiness until the problem is solved. So I solve it as quickly as possible. I literally won\u2019t sleep until it\u2019s solved\u2014maybe that\u2019s just a personal characteristic. But it\u2019s worked out well in business.\nBe Too Busy to \u2018Do Coffee\u2019\nRuthlessly decline meetings\nBe too busy to \u2018do coffee\u2019 while keeping an uncluttered calendar\nNaval: Another tweet was: \u201cYou should be too busy to \u2018do coffee,\u2019 while still keeping an uncluttered calendar.\u201d\nPeople who know me know I\u2019m famous for simultaneously doing two things.\nFirst, I keep a very clean calendar. I have almost no meetings on it. When some people see my calendar, they almost weep.\nSecond, I\u2019m busy all the time. I\u2019m always doing something. It\u2019s usually work-related. It\u2019s whatever high-impact thing that needs to be done, that I\u2019m most inspired to do.\nThe only way to do that is to constantly, and ruthlessly, decline meetings.\nPeople want to \u201cdo coffee\u201d and build relationships. That\u2019s fine early in your career, when you\u2019re still exploring. But later in your career\u2014when you\u2019re exploiting, and there are more things coming at you than you have time for\u2014you have to ruthlessly cut meetings out of your life.\nRuthlessly cut meetings\nIf someone wants a meeting, see if they will do a call instead. If they want to call, see if they will email instead. If they want to email, see if they will text instead. And you probably should ignore most text messages\u2014unless they\u2019re true emergencies.\nYou have to be utterly ruthless about dodging meetings. When you do meetings, make them walking meetings. Do standing meetings. Keep them short, actionable and small. Nothing is getting done in a meeting with eight people around a conference table. You are literally dying one hour at a time.\nNivi: \u201cDoing coffee\u201d reminds me of an old quote, I think from Steve Jobs, when someone asked him why Apple didn\u2019t come to a convention. His response was something like, \u201cBecause we wouldn\u2019t be here working.\u201d\nNaval: I used to have a tough time turning people down for meetings. Now I just tell them outright, \u201cI don\u2019t do non-transactional meetings. I don\u2019t do meetings without a strict agenda. I don\u2019t do meetings unless we absolutely have to.\u201d\nNivi used to do this. When people asked us for get-to-know-you meetings, he would say, \u201cWe don\u2019t do meetings unless it\u2019s life-and-death urgent.\u201d The person has to respond, \u201cYeah, it\u2019s life-and-death urgent\u201d or there\u2019s no meeting.\nPeople will meet with you when you have proof of work\nBusy people will take your meeting when you have something important or valuable. But you have to come with a proper calling card. It should be: \u201cHere\u2019s what I\u2019ve done. Here\u2019s what I can show you. Let\u2019s meet if this is useful to you, and I\u2019ll be respectful of your time.\u201d\nYou have to build up credibility. For example, when a tech investor looks at a startup, the first thing they want to see is evidence of product progress. They don\u2019t just want to see a slide deck. Product progress is the entrepreneur\u2019s resume. It\u2019s an unfake-able resume.\nYou have to do the work. To use a crypto analogy, you have to have proof of work. If you have that and you truly have something interesting, then you shouldn\u2019t hesitate to put it together in an email and send it. Even then, when asking for a meeting, you want to be actionable.\nFree your time and mind\nIf you think you\u2019re going to \u201cmake it\u201d by networking and attending a bunch of meetings, you\u2019re probably wrong. Networking can be important early in your career. And you can get serendipitous with meetings. But the odds are pretty low.\nWhen you meet people hoping for that lucky break, you\u2019re relying on Type One luck, which is blind luck, and Type Two luck, which is hustle luck.\nBut you\u2019re not getting Type Three or Type Four luck, which are the better kinds. This is where you spend time developing a reputation and working on something. You develop a unique point of view and are able to spot opportunities that others can\u2019t.\nA busy calendar and a busy mind will destroy your ability to do great things in this world. If you want to do great things\u2014whether you\u2019re a musician or entrepreneur or investor\u2014you need free time and a free mind.\nKeep Redefining What You Do\nBecome the best in the world at what you do\nKeep redefining what you do until you\u2019re the best at what you do\nNivi: We talked about the importance of working hard and valuing your time. Next, there are a few tweets on the topic of working for the long-term. The first tweet is: \u201cBecome the best in the world at what you do. Keep redefining what you do until this is true.\u201d\nNaval: If you really want to get paid in this world, you want to be number one at whatever you do. It can be niche\u2014that\u2019s the point. You can literally get paid for just being you.\nSome of the more successful people in the world are that way. Oprah gets paid for being Oprah. Joe Rogan gets paid for being Joe Rogan. They\u2019re being authentic to themselves.\nYou want to be number one. And you want to keep changing what you do until you\u2019re number one. You can\u2019t just pick something arbitrary. You can\u2019t say, \u201cI\u2019m going to be the fastest runner in the world,\u201d and now you have to beat Usain Bolt. That\u2019s too hard of a problem.\nKeep changing your objective until it arrives at your specific knowledge, skill sets, position, capabilities, location and interests. Your objective and skills should converge to make you number one.\nWhen you\u2019re searching for what to do, you have two different foci to keep in mind. One is, \u201cI want to be the best at what I do.\u201d The second is, \u201cWhat I do is flexible, so that I\u2019m the best at it.\u201d\nYou want to arrive at a comfortable place where you feel, \u201cThis is something I can be amazing at, while still being authentic to who I am.\u201d\nIt\u2019s going to be a long journey. But now you know how to think about it.\nFind founder-product-market fit\nThe most important thing for any company is to find product-market fit. But the most important thing for any entrepreneur is to find founder-product-market fit, where you are naturally inclined to to build the right product for a market. That\u2019s a three-foci problem. You have to make all three work at once.\nIf you want to be successful in life, you have to get comfortable managing multi-variate problems and multiple-objective functions at once. This is one of those cases where you have to map at least two or three at once.\nEscape Competition Through Authenticity\nNobody can compete with you on being you\nCompetition will trap you in a lesser game\nNivi: Let\u2019s discuss your tweet: \u201cEscape competition through authenticity.\u201d It sounds like part of this is a search for who you are.\nNaval: It\u2019s both a search and a recognition. Sometimes when we search our egos, we want to be something that we\u2019re not. Our friends and family are actually better at telling us who we are. Looking back at what we\u2019ve done is a better indicator of who we are.\nPeter Thiel talks a lot about how competition is besides the point. It\u2019s counterproductive. We\u2019re highly memetic creatures. We copy everybody around us. We copy our desires from them.\nIf everyone around me is a great artist, I want to be an artist. If everyone around me is a great businessperson, I want to be a businessperson. If everybody around me is a social activist, I want to be a social activist. That\u2019s where my self-esteem will come from.\nYou have to be careful when you get caught up in status games. You end up competing over things that aren\u2019t worth competing over.\nPeter Thiel talks about how he was going to be a law clerk because everybody at law school wanted to clerk for a Supreme Court justice or some famous judge. He got rejected, and that\u2019s what made him go into business. It helped him break out of a lesser game and into a greater game.\nSometimes you get trapped in the wrong game because you\u2019re competing. The best way to escape competition\u2014to get away from the specter of competition, which is not just stressful and nerve-wracking but also will drive you to the wrong answer\u2014is to be authentic to yourself.\nNo one can compete with you on being you\nIf you are building and marketing something that\u2019s an extension of who you are, no one can compete with you. Who\u2019s going to compete with Joe Rogan or Scott Adams? It\u2019s impossible. Is somebody else going write a better Dilbert? No. Is someone going to compete with Bill Watterson and create a better Calvin and Hobbes? No.\nArtist are, by definition, authentic. Entrepreneurs are authentic, too. Who\u2019s going to be Elon Musk? Who\u2019s going to be Jack Dorsey? These people are authentic, and the businesses and products they create are authentic to their desires and means.\nIf somebody else came along and started launching rockets, I don\u2019t think it would faze Elon one bit. He\u2019s still going to get to Mars. Because that\u2019s his mission, insane as it seems. He\u2019s going to accomplish it.\nAuthenticity naturally gets you away from competition. Does it mean that you want to be authentic to the point where there\u2019s no product-market fit? It may turn out that you\u2019re the best juggler on a unicycle. But maybe there isn\u2019t much of a market for that, even with YouTube videos. So you have to adjust until you find product-market fit.\nAt least lean towards authenticity, towards getting away from competition. Competition leads to copy-catting and playing the completely wrong game.\nIn entrepreneurship, the masses are never right\nIn entrepreneurship, the masses are never right. If the masses knew how to build great things and create great wealth, we\u2019d all be rich by now.\nWhen you see a lot of competition, sometimes that indicates the masses have already arrived. It\u2019s already competed over too much. Or it\u2019s the wrong trend to begin with.\nOn the other hand, if the whole market is empty, that can be a warning indicator. It can indicate you\u2019ve gone too authentic and should focus more on the product-market part of founder-product-market fit.\nThere\u2019s a balance you have to find. Generally, people will make the mistake of paying too much attention to the competition. The great founders tend to be authentic iconoclasts.\nCombine your vocation and avocation\nNivi: Do you think one way of getting to authenticity is by finding five or six various skills you already do and stacking them on top of each other, maybe not even in any purposeful way? If you are expressing who you are, you\u2019re going to be expressing all of these skills anyway.\nNaval: If you are successful, in the long-term you\u2019ll find you\u2019re almost doing all of your hobbies for a living, no matter what they are. As Robert Frost said, \u201cmy goal in life is to unite my avocation with my vocation.\u201d That\u2019s really where life is going to lead you anyway.\nYou\u2019re right about the skill stack. Everyone has multiple skills. We aren\u2019t one-dimensional creatures, even though that\u2019s how we portray ourselves in online profiles to get employed. You meet somebody and they say, \u201cI\u2019m a banker.\u201d Or, \u201cI\u2019m a bartender. Or \u201cI\u2019m a barber.\u201d\nSpecialize in being you\nBut people are multivariate. They have a lot of skills. One banker might be good at finance. Another one might be good at sales. A third one might be good at macroeconomic trends and have a feel for markets. Another one might be really good at picking individual stocks. Another might be good at maintaining relationships, rather than selling new relationships. Everyone\u2019s going to have various niches. And you\u2019re going to have multiple niches. It\u2019s not going to be just one.\nAs you go through your career, you\u2019ll find you gravitate towards the things you\u2019re good at, which by definition are the things you enjoy doing. Otherwise, you wouldn\u2019t be good at them. You wouldn\u2019t have put in the time.\nOther people will push you towards the things you\u2019re good at, too. Because your smart bosses, co-workers and investors will realize you\u2019re world-class in this one thing. And you can recruit people to help you with other things.\nIdeally, you want to end up specializing in being you.\nPlay Stupid Games, Win Stupid Prizes\nCompetition will blind you to greater games\nBusinesses that seem like they\u2019re in direct competition really aren\u2019t\nNivi: When you\u2019re being authentic, you don\u2019t mind competition that much. It pisses you off and inspires some fear, jealousy and other emotions. But you don\u2019t really mind because you\u2019re oriented towards the goal and the mission. Worst-case, you might get some ideas from them. And often there are ways to work with the competition in a positive way that ends up increasing the size of the market for you.\nNaval: It depends on the nature of the business. The best Silicon Valley tech industry businesses tend to be winner-take-all. When you see competition, it can make you fly into a rage. Because it really does endanger everything you\u2019ve built.\nIf I\u2019m opening a restaurant and a more interesting version of the same restaurant opens in a different town, that\u2019s fantastic. I\u2019m going to copy what\u2019s working and drop what\u2019s not working. So it depends on the nature of the business.\nOften, businesses that seem to be in direct competition really aren\u2019t. They end up adjacent or slightly different. You\u2019re one step away from a completely different business, and sometimes you need to take that step. You\u2019re not going to take it if you\u2019re busy fighting over a booby prize.\nYou\u2019re playing a stupid game. You\u2019re going to win a stupid prize. It\u2019s not obvious right now because you\u2019re blinded by competition. But three years from now, it\u2019ll be obvious.\nMy first company got caught in the wrong game\nOne of my first startups was Epinions, an online product review site that was independent of Amazon. That space eventually turned into TripAdvisor and Yelp, which is where we should have gone.\nWe should have done more local reviews. A review of a scarce item like a local restaurant is more valuable than one of an item like a camera that has 1,000 reviews on Amazon.\nBefore we could get there, we got caught up in the comparison-shopping game. We merged with DealTime and competed with a bunch of price-comparison engines\u2014mySimon, PriceGrabber, NexTag and Bizrate, which became Shopzilla. We were caught in fierce competition with each other.\nThat whole space went to zero because Amazon won e-tail completely. There was no need for price comparison. Everyone just went to Amazon.\nWe got the booby prize because we were caught up in competition with a bunch of our peers. We should have been looking at what the consumer really wanted and being authentic to ourselves, which was reviews, not price comparison. We should have gone further into esoteric items where customers had less data and wanted reviews more badly.\nIf we stayed authentic to ourselves, we would have done better.\nEventually You Will Get What You Deserve\nOn a long enough timescale, you will get paid\nOn a long enough time scale, you will get paid\nNivi: We\u2019re talking about working for the long-term. The next tweet on that topic: \u201cApply specific knowledge, with leverage, and eventually you will get what you deserve.\u201d\nI would add: Apply judgment, apply accountability, and apply the skill of reading.\nNaval: This one is a glib way of saying, \u201cIt takes time.\u201d Once you have all of the pieces in place, there\u2019s still an indeterminate amount of time you have to put in. And if you\u2019re counting, you\u2019ll run out of patience before it arrives.\nYou have to make sure you give these things time. Life is long.\nCharlie Munger had a line on this. Somebody asked him about making money. He said what the questioner actually was asking was, \u201cHow can I become like you, except faster?\u201d\nEverybody wants it immediately. But the world is an efficient place. Immediate doesn\u2019t work. You have to put in the time. You have to put in the hours. You have to put yourself in that position with specific knowledge, accountability, leverage and an authentic skill-set in order to be the best in the world at what you do.\nAnd then you have to enjoy it and keep doing it and doing it and doing it. Don\u2019t keep track. Don\u2019t keep count. Because if you do, you will run out of time.\nLooking back on my career, the people who I identified as brilliant and hardworking two decades ago are all successful now, almost without exception. On a long enough timescale, you will get paid.\nBut it can easily be 10 or 20 years. Sometimes it\u2019s five. If it\u2019s five, or three, and it\u2019s a friend of yours who got there, it can drive you insane. But those are exceptions. And for every winner, there are multiple failures.\nOne thing that\u2019s important in entrepreneurship: You just have to be right once. You get many, many shots on goal. You can take a shot on goal every three to five years, maybe every 10 at the slowest. Or once every year at the fastest, depending on how you\u2019re iterating with startups. But you only have to be right once.\nWhat are you really good at, that the market values?\nNivi: Your eventual outcome will be equal to something like the distinctiveness of your specific knowledge; times how much leverage you can apply to that knowledge; times how often your judgment is correct; times how singularly accountable you are for the outcome; times how much society values what you\u2019re doing. Then you compound that with how long you can keep doing it and how long you can keep improving it through reading and learning.\nNaval: That\u2019s a really good way to summarize it. It\u2019s worth trying to sketch that equation out.\nThat said, people try to apply mathematics to what is really philosophy. I\u2019ve seen this happen, where I say one thing and then I say another thing that seems contradictory if you treat it as math. But it\u2019s obviously in a different context.\nPeople will say, \u201cYou say, \u2018Desire is suffering.\u2019\u201d You know, the Buddhist saying. \u201cAnd then you \u2018All greatness comes from suffering.\u2019 So does that mean all greatness comes from desire?\u201d This isn\u2019t math. You can\u2019t just carry variables around and form absolute logical outputs. You have to know when to apply things.\nOne can\u2019t get too analytical about it.\nIt\u2019s what a physicist would call \u201cfalse precision.\u201d When you take two made-up estimates and multiply them together, you get four degrees of precision. Those decimal points don\u2019t actually count. You don\u2019t have that data. You don\u2019t have that knowledge. The more estimated variables you have, the greater the error in the model.\nAdding more complexity to your decision-making process gets you a worse answer. You\u2019re better off picking the single biggest thing or two. Ask yourself: What am I really good at, according to observation and people I trust, that the market values?\nThose two variables alone are probably good enough. If you\u2019re good at it, you\u2019ll keep it up. You\u2019ll develop the judgment. If you\u2019re good at it and you like to do it, eventually people will give you the resources and you won\u2019t be afraid to take on accountability. So the other pieces will fall into place.\nProduct-market fit is inevitable if you\u2019re doing something you love and the market wants it.\nReject Most Advice\nMost advice is people giving you their winning lottery ticket numbers\nThe best founders listen to everyone but make up their own mind\nNivi: One of the tweets from the cutting-room floor was: \u201cAvoid people who got rich quickly. They\u2019re just giving you their winning lottery ticket numbers.\u201d\nNaval: This is generally true of most advice. It goes back to Scott Adams\u2014systems not goals. If you ask a successful person what worked for them, they often read out the exact set of things that worked for them, which might not apply to you. They\u2019re just reading you their winning lottery ticket numbers.\nIt\u2019s a little glib. There is something to be learned, but you can\u2019t take their exact circumstance and map it onto yours. The best founders I know read and listen to everyone. But then they ignore everyone and make up their own mind.\nThey have their own internal model of how to apply things to their situation. And they do not hesitate to discard information. If you survey enough people, all of the advice will cancel to zero.\nYou have to have your own point of view. When something is sent your way, you have to quickly decide: Is it true? Is it true outside of the context of how that person applied it? Is it true in my context? And then, Do I want to apply it?\nYou have to reject most advice. But you have to listen to enough of it, and read enough of it, to know what to reject and what to accept.\nEven in this podcast, you should examine everything. If something doesn\u2019t feel true to you, put it down. Set it aside. If too many things seem untrue, delete this podcast.\nAdvice offers anecdotes to recall later, when you get your own experience\nNivi: I think the most dangerous part of taking advice is that the person who gave it to you isn\u2019t going to be around to tell you when it doesn\u2019t apply any more.\nNaval: I view the purpose of advice a little differently than most people. I view it as helping me have anecdotes and maxims that I can recall when I have my own direct experience and say, \u201cAh, that\u2019s what that person meant.\u201d\nNinety percent of my tweets are maxims that become mental hooks to remind me when I\u2019m in that situation again.\nLike, \u201cOh, I\u2019m the one who tweeted, \u2018If you can\u2019t see yourself working with someone for life, then don\u2019t work with them for a day.\u2019\u201d As soon as I know I\u2019m not going to be working with someone 10 years from now, then I have to start extricating myself from that relationship or investing less effort in it.\nI use tweets to compress my own learnings. Your brain space is finite. You have finite neurons. You can think of these as pointers, addresses, mnemonics to help you remember deep-seated principles where you have the underlying experience to back it up.\nIf you don\u2019t have the underlying experience, then it reads like a collection of quotes. It\u2019s cool. It\u2019s inspirational for a moment. Maybe you make a nice poster out of it. But then you forget it and move on.\nThese are compact ways for you to recall your own knowledge.\nA Calm Mind, a Fit Body, a House Full of Love\nWhen you\u2019re finally wealthy, you\u2019ll realize it wasn\u2019t what you were seeking in the first place\nWhen you\u2019re wealthy, you\u2019ll realize it wasn\u2019t what you were seeking\nNivi: The last tweet on the topic of working for the long-term is: \u201cWhen you\u2019re finally wealthy, you\u2019ll realize it wasn\u2019t what you were seeking in the first place. But that\u2019s for another day.\u201d\nNaval: That\u2019s a multi-hour topic in and of itself. First of all, I thought it was a really clever way to end the whole thing. It disarms a whole set of people who say, \u201cWhat\u2019s the point of getting rich?\u201d There are a lot of people who like to virtue signal against the idea of wealth creation or making money.\nIt\u2019s also true. Yes, money will solve all your money problems. But it doesn\u2019t get you everywhere.\nThe first thing you realize when you\u2019ve made a bunch of money is that you\u2019re still the same person. If you\u2019re happy, you\u2019re happy. If you\u2019re unhappy, you\u2019re unhappy. If you\u2019re calm and fulfilled and peaceful, you\u2019re still that same person. I know lots of very rich people who are extremely out of shape. I know lots of rich people who have really bad family lives. I know lots of rich people who are internally a mess.\nA calm mind, a fit body and a house full of love must be earned\nI would lean on another tweet that I put out. When I think back on it, I think it\u2019s my favorite tweet. It\u2019s not necessarily the most insightful. It\u2019s not necessarily the most helpful. It\u2019s not even the one I think about the most. But when I look at it, there\u2019s such a certain truth in there that it resonates. And that is: \u201cA fit body, a calm mind, a house full of love. These things cannot be bought\u2014they must be earned.\u201d\nEven if you have all the money in the world, you can\u2019t have those three things. Jeff Bezos still has to work out. He still has to work on his marriage. And his internal mental state still very much won\u2019t be controlled by external events. It\u2019s going to be based on how calm and peaceful he is inside.\nSo I think those three things\u2014your health, your mental health and your close relationships\u2014are things you have to cultivate. They can bring you a lot more peace and happiness than any amount of money ever will.\nPractical advice for a calmer internal state\nHow to get there is a tweetstorm I\u2019ve been working on. I have probably 100 tweets on it. It\u2019s very hard to say anything on the topic without getting attacked from 50 different directions, especially these days on Twitter. So I\u2019ve been hesitant to do it. I want to target it for a very specific kind of person.\nThere\u2019s a bunch of people who don\u2019t believe working on your internal state is useful. They\u2019re too focused on the external. And that\u2019s fine, there\u2019s nothing wrong with that. That\u2019s who the \u201cHow to Get Rich\u201d tweetstorm is for. There\u2019s a bunch of people who believe the only thing worth working on is complete liberation. Like, you become the Buddha. They\u2019ll attack anything in the middle as being useless. That\u2019s fine, too. But most people aren\u2019t there.\nI want to create a tweetstorm that offers practical advice for everyday people who want a calmer internal state. A set of understandings, realizations, half-truths and truths, that if you were to imbibe them properly\u2014and, again, these are pointers to ideas you already have and experiences you already have\u2014that if you keep these top of mind, slowly but steadily it will help you with certain realizations that will lead you to a calmer internal state. That\u2019s what I want to work on.\nFitness is another big one, I\u2019m just not the expert there. There are plenty of good people on Twitter that who are better at fitness than me.\nA lot of divorces happen over money, a lot of battles happen over internal anger\nI think a loving household and relationships actually fall naturally out of the other things. If you have a calm mind and you\u2019ve already made money, you should have good relationships. There\u2019s no reason why you shouldn\u2019t. A lot of divorces happen over money. Unfortunately, that\u2019s just the reality of it. Having money removes that part of it.\nA lot of external battles happen because your internal state is not good. When you\u2019re naturally internally peaceful you\u2019re going to pick fewer fights. You\u2019re going to be more loving without expecting anything in return. That will take care of things on the external-relationship front.\nNivi: To summarize: Money solves your money problems. Money buys you freedom in the material world. And money lets you not do the things you don\u2019t want to do.\nNaval: Yeah. To me the ultimate purpose of money is so you don\u2019t have to be in a specific place, at a specific time, doing anything you don\u2019t want to do.\nThere Are No Get Rich Quick Schemes\nGet rich quick schemes are just someone else getting rich off you\nThere are no get rich quick schemes\nNivi: We skipped one tweet because I wanted to cover all of the tweets on the topic of the long-term. The tweet we skipped: \u201cThere are no get rich quick schemes. That\u2019s just someone else getting rich off you.\u201d\nNaval: This goes back to the world being an efficient place. If there\u2019s an easy way to get rich, it\u2019s already been exploited. There are a lot of people who will sell you ideas and schemes on how to make money. But they\u2019re always selling you some $79.95 course or some audiobook or seminar.\nWhich is fine. Everyone needs to eat. People need to make a living. They might actually have really good tips. If they\u2019re giving you actionable, high-quality advice that acknowledges it\u2019s a difficult journey and will take a lot of time, then I think it\u2019s realistic.\nBut if they\u2019re selling you some get rich quick scheme\u2014whether it\u2019s crypto or whether it\u2019s an online business or seminar\u2014they\u2019re just making money off you. That\u2019s their get rich quick scheme. It\u2019s not necessarily going to work for you.\nWe don\u2019t have ads because it would ruin our credibility\nOne of the things about this whole tweetstorm and podcast is that we don\u2019t have ads. We don\u2019t charge for anything. We don\u2019t sell anything. Not because I don\u2019t want to make more money\u2014it\u2019s always nice to make more money; we\u2019re doing work here\u2014but because it would completely destroy the credibility of the enterprise. If I say, \u201cI know how to get rich, and I\u2019m going to sell that to you,\u201d then it ruins it.\nWhen I was young, one of my favorite books on the topic was \u201cHow To Get Rich,\u201d by Felix Dennis, the founder of Maxim Magazine. He had a lot of crazy stuff in there. But he had some really good insights too.\nWhenever I read something by him or by GoDaddy founder Bob Parsons or Andrew Carnegie\u2014people who are already very wealthy, and they clearly made their wealth in other fields, not by selling the how-to-get-rich line\u2014they have a credibility. You just trust them.\nThey\u2019re not trying to make money off of you. They\u2019re obviously trying to win some status and some ego\u2014you always have to have a motivation for doing something. But at least that\u2019s a cleaner reason and why they\u2019re probably not lying. They\u2019re probably not fooling you. They\u2019re not snowing you.\nEvery founder has to lie to every employee\nAt some level every founder has to lie to every employee of the company they have. They have to convince them, \u201cIt\u2019s better for you to work for me than to do what I did and go work for yourself.\u201d\nI\u2019ve always had a hard time with that.\nThe only honest way to do this, in my opinion, is to tell the entrepreneurs I recruit: \u201cYou\u2019re going to be entrepreneurial in this company, and the day you\u2019re ready to start your own next thing, I\u2019m going to support you. I\u2019m never going to get in the way of you starting a company. But this can be a good place for you to learn how to build a good team and build a good culture; how to find product-market fit; how to perfect your skills; and to meet some amazing people while you figure out exactly what it is you\u2019re going to do. Because positioning, timing and deliberation are very important when starting a company.\u201d\nWhat I\u2019ve never been able to do is to look them in the face and say, \u201cYou must be at your desk by 8 a.m.\u201d Because I\u2019m not going to be at my desk by 8 a.m. I want my freedom. I\u2019ve never been able to say to them, \u201cYou\u2019re great at being a director today, and you\u2019ll be a VP tomorrow,\u201d putting them into that cold career path track. Because I don\u2019t believe in it myself.\nAnyone giving advice on how to get rich should have made their money elsewhere\nIf anyone is giving advice on how to get rich and they\u2019re also making money off of it, they should have made their money elsewhere. You don\u2019t want to learn how to be fit from a fat person. You don\u2019t want to learn how to be happy from a depressed person. So, you don\u2019t want to learn how to be rich from a poor person. But you also don\u2019t want to learn how to be rich from somebody who makes their money by telling people how to be rich. It\u2019s suspect.\nNivi: Any time you see somebody who\u2019s gotten rich following some guru\u2019s advice on getting rich, remember that in any random process, if you run it long enough and if enough people participate in it, you will always get every single possible outcome with probability one.\nNaval: There\u2019s a lot of random error in there. This is why you have to absolutely and completely ignore business journalists and economist academics when they talk about private companies.\nI won\u2019t name names, but when a famous economist rails on Bitcoin, or when a business journalist attacks the latest company that\u2019s IPO\u2019ing, it\u2019s complete nonsense. Those people have never built anything. They\u2019re professional critics. They don\u2019t know anything about making money. All they know is how to criticize and get pageviews. And you\u2019re literally becoming dumber by reading them. You\u2019re burning neurons.\nI\u2019ll leave you with a quote from Nassim Taleb that I liked. He said, \u201cTo become a philosopher king, start with being a king, not being a philosopher.\u201d\nNivi: I\u2019m glad you brought up Taleb, because I was going to finish this by saying: remember the title of his first book, \u201cFooled By Randomness.\u201d\nNaval: One of the reasons we\u2019re a little vague in this podcast is because we\u2019re trying to lay down principles that are timeless, as opposed to giving you the winning lottery ticket numbers from yesterday.\nProductize Yourself\nFigure out what you\u2019re uniquely good at, and apply as much leverage as possible\nFigure out what you\u2019re uniquely good at and apply as much leverage as possible\nNivi: You summarized this entire tweetstorm with two words: \u201cProductize yourself.\u201d\nNaval: Productize has specific knowledge and leverage. Yourself has uniqueness and accountability. Yourself also has specific knowledge. So you can combine all of these pieces into these two words.\nIf you\u2019re looking towards the long-term, you should ask yourself, \u201cIs this authentic to me? Is it myself that I\u2019m projecting?\u201d And then, \u201cAm I productizing it? Am I scaling it? Am I scaling with labor or capital or code or media?\u201d It\u2019s a very handy, simple mnemonic.\nWhat is this podcast? This is a podcast called Naval. I\u2019m literally productizing myself with a podcast.\nNivi: You want to figure out what you\u2019re uniquely good at\u2014or what you uniquely are\u2014 and apply as much leverage as possible. So making money isn\u2019t even something you do. It\u2019s not a skill. It\u2019s who you are, stamped out a million times.\nFind hobbies that make you rich, fit and creative\nNaval: Making money should be a function of your identity and what you like to do. Another tweet I really liked was, \u201cFind three hobbies: One that makes you money, one that keeps you fit, and one that makes you creative.\u201d\nI would change that slightly. I would say: One that makes you money, one that makes you fit, and one that makes you smarter. So in my case, my hobbies would be reading and making money, as I love working with startups, investing in them, brainstorming them, starting them. I love the ideation and initial creation phase around startups.\nOn the hobby that keeps you fit, I don\u2019t really have one. The closest thing I have is yoga, but that\u2019s where I sort of fell apart. I think people who, early in life, discover something like surfing or swimming or tennis or some kind of a sport they continue doing throughout most of their life are very lucky, because they found a hobby that will make them fit.\nAccountability Means Letting People Criticize You\nYou have to stick your neck out and be willing to fail publicly\nAccountability means letting people criticize you\nNivi: We finished discussing the tweetstorm. We\u2019re going to spend some time on Q&A and discussing tweets that didn\u2019t make it into the \u201cHow to Get Rich\u201d tweetstorm. My first question: What are some common failures or things people typically do wrong when they try to apply this advice?\nNaval: A lot of people don\u2019t understand what specific knowledge is or how to \u201cobtain\u201d it. People don\u2019t understand what accountability entails. They think accountability means being successfully accountable. No\u2014it means you have to stick your neck out and fail publicly. You have to be willing to let people criticize you.\nOne of the reasons I\u2019m less active on Twitter lately is because every tweet summons an army of nitpickers and haters. It gets exhausting. You have to learn to ignore them, or you won\u2019t survive on Twitter.\nA lot of people try to reconcile this by asking, \u201cShould I quit my 9-to-5 job or not?\u201d That can be a hard decision. You don\u2019t need to go to that extreme. You can start applying accountability, leverage and specific knowledge within your existing career. You don\u2019t necessarily need to fork off and do something else completely different.\nThe most interesting parts should be the ones you disagree with\nPeople will use my advice as a way to agree and disagree with their existing biases. They\u2019ll say, \u201cI agree with that part,\u201d and, \u201cThat part you\u2019re completely wrong.\u201d The most interesting tweets should be the ones you disagree with\u2014because clearly I\u2019ve proven I know a few things. If you disagree with it, maybe that\u2019s an area where you can improve your thinking. I improve my thinking all the time.\nIn this tweetstorm I put down the minimum-viable principles. I shared only a small slice of what I\u2019ve learned about how to make money; because 90% of it is suspect.\nI put down the bedrock, the stuff I\u2019m sure about. I have not yet seen a tweet successfully contradicting anything in this tweetstorm that would cause me to say, \u201cI got that one wrong.\u201d\nGet the free leverage that\u2019s available in tech\nSome people will say, \u201cThis only applies to tech entrepreneurs.\u201d I disagree. The real estate example was a good one in that regard.\nTechnology drives leverage\u2014so I\u2019m going to push you in a tech direction to get that free leverage. Obviously, this message is being delivered through the Internet, so it\u2019s going to have a pro-Internet bias.\nDon\u2019t refuse to do things just because others can\u2019t do them\nSome people believe it\u2019s unfair to do anything with the opportunities they have because others don\u2019t have the same opportunities. With a defeatist attitude like that, why even get out of bed in the morning? Ninety percent of people are dead.\nMany people live on a dollar or less a day. Do you? No. You play the hand you\u2019re dealt to the best of your ability. Then you can take the winnings\u2014the pot from that hand\u2014and do whatever you want with it to fix the world.\nBut if you refuse to do things just because others can\u2019t do them, you are living in denial. It\u2019s an excuse to do nothing.\nRealize your philanthropic vision by running a business\nOthers believe wealth creation is fundamentally at odds with an environmentally healthy planet. They view it as a giant zero-sum game. That\u2019s a false narrative, too. Elon Musk is not playing a zero-sum game with the environment; there are plenty of entrepreneurs like him.\nThere is a word environmentalists love: sustainability. If nothing else, for-profit businesses are financially sustainable. You can do a B Corporation, which has a dual mission.\nMany non-profit efforts would be better off as for-profit companies. They wouldn\u2019t have to beg for grants. They would be financially sustainable. Some great founders realize their philanthropic visions by running a business.\nWe Should Eventually Be Working for Ourselves\nBut we will have to make sacrifices and take on more risk\nThis advice is for anybody who wants to be entrepreneurial\nNivi: Who is this advice targeted to? Is it for my Lyft driver? Is it for an Internet entrepreneur? Is it for somebody who wants to start a YouTube channel?\nNaval: Because it comes from someone who\u2019s steeped in Silicon Valley and tech companies, it\u2019s always going to have a bias towards that.\nBut I think it\u2019s good for anybody who wants to be entrepreneurial. Anybody who wants to control their own life. Anybody who wants to deterministically and reliably improve their ability to create wealth over time, is patient, and is looking at the long haul.\nIf you\u2019re 80 years old, retired and running out of energy, it\u2019s probably best to stay retired. But there are 80-year-olds who have a lot of energy, who want to do new things and live for the future.\nObviously this can apply very easily to a young person. I would say 9 or 10 years old and up.\nMidlife can be the most fruitful time to apply this advice\nThe most difficult one is probably midlife. When we\u2019re in our 30s, 40s and 50s, we already have a lot invested. We have a lot of obligations. Those are the years we\u2019re earning; people are relying on us. We don\u2019t want to change, because we don\u2019t want to admit defeat.\nBut that\u2019s when it actually can be the most fruitful. It may be the most difficult pivot: You have a 9-to-5 job; you have a family relying on you.\nIt may seem like the things in this podcast are far too idealistic, but maybe it can inform your weekend projects. Maybe it can inform your approach to education; for example, if you\u2019re taking an online course at night. Maybe it can inform what roles you take on at your current company, because they move you closer and closer to points of leverage, points of judgment or points where you\u2019re naturally talented, and you\u2019re able to be more authentic. It might cause you to take on more accountability.\nEven if applied piecemeal, these principles can guide you\u2014regardless of what stage of life you are in, short of retirement. If you\u2019re retired, test them to see if they\u2019re true and then teach them to your kids or grandkids.\nThere are many different ways to participate. It should apply to almost everybody who has a complete body, sound mind, and is looking to work.\nLook up the value chain to find leverage\nNivi: One way to apply this advice is to look at who is getting leverage off of the work that you\u2019re doing. Look up the value chain\u2014at who\u2019s above you and who\u2019s above them\u2014and see how they are taking advantage of the time and work you\u2019re doing and how they\u2019re applying leverage.\nPeople naturally do this because they want to move up the corporate ladder; but that\u2019s mostly about managing other people. You want to manage more capital, products, media and community.\nPeople think about moving up the ladder in their organization. But they don\u2019t often think about moving to a different organization or creating their own company to get more leverage.\nYou will do better in a small organization\nNaval: In general, ceteris paribus\u2014fancy Latin words for \u201call other things equal\u201d\u2014you will do better in a smaller organization than a larger one.\nYou will have more accountability, and your work will be more visible. You\u2019re more likely to be able to try different things, which can help you discover the thing you are uniquely good at. People will be more likely to give you leverage through battlefield promotions. You\u2019ll have more flexibility. There will be more authenticity in how the company operates.\nHere is a good progression for a career: Start in a large company and progressively move to smaller and smaller ones. It\u2019s very hard to go from a small company to a larger company. Larger companies tend to be more about politics than merit; they\u2019re more stable but less innovative.\nThe goal is that we are all working for ourselves\nThe long-term goal is that we are all wealthy and working for ourselves. The people working for us are essentially robots. Today that\u2019s software robots executing code in data centers. Tomorrow it could be delivery bots, flying bots and mechanical bots\u2014and drones\u2014that are carrying things around.\nThis goes back to the idea that the best relationships are peer relationships. If there\u2019s someone above you, that\u2019s someone to learn from. If you\u2019re not learning from them and improving, nobody should be above you.\nIf there\u2019s somebody below you, it\u2019s because you\u2019re teaching them and enabling them. If you\u2019re not doing that, then get a robot; you don\u2019t need a human below you.\nThis is utopian and still a long way off, but in the not-too-distant future anybody who wants to work for themself will be able to do it.\nYou may have to make sacrifices and take on more risk. You may have to take on more accountability and live with less steady income. But more and more I think younger people are realizing that if they\u2019re going to work, they\u2019re going to work for themselves.\nBeing Ethical Is Long-Term Greedy\nIf you cut fair deals, you will get paid in the long run\nEthics isn\u2019t something you study; it\u2019s something you do\nNivi: In the \u201cHow to Get Rich\u201d tweetstorm you listed things you suggest people study, like programming, sales, reading, writing and arithmetic. One of the items that ended up on the cutting-room floor was ethics, which you also suggest people study.\nNaval: I was going to put that out as a concession to people who believe making money is evil and that the only way to make it is to be evil. But then I realized ethics is not necessarily something you study. It\u2019s something you think about\u2014and something you do.\nEveryone has a personal moral code. Where we get our moral code differs for everybody. It\u2019s not like I can point you to a textbook. I can point you to some Roman or Greek text, but that\u2019s not suddenly going to make you ethical.\nThere\u2019s the Golden Rule: \u201cDo unto others as you would have them do unto you.\u201d Or there\u2019s Nassim Taleb\u2019s Silver Rule, which is, \u201cDon\u2019t do unto others what you don\u2019t want them doing unto you. \u201d\nTrust leads to compounding relationships\nOnce you\u2019ve been in business long enough, you will realize how much of it is about trust. It\u2019s about trust because you want to compound interest. You want to work with trustworthy people for long periods of time without having to reevaluate every discussion or constantly look over your shoulder.\nOver time you will gravitate to working with certain kinds of people. Similarly, those people will gravitate to working with other ethical people.\nBeing ethical attracts other long-term players\nActing ethically turns out to be a selfish imperative. You want to be ethical because it attracts other long-term players in the network. They want to do business with ethical people.\nIf you build a reputation for being ethical, people eventually will pay you just to do deals through you. Your involvement will validate deals and ensure they get done; because you wouldn\u2019t be involved with low-quality stuff.\nIn the long-run, being ethical pays off\u2014but it\u2019s the very long run. In the short-run, being unethical pays off, which is why so many people go for it. It\u2019s short-term greedy.\nBeing ethical is long-term greedy\nYou can be ethical simply because you\u2019re long-term greedy. I can even outline a framework for different parts of ethics just based on the idea of long-term selfishness.\nFor example, you want to be honest because it leaves you with a clear mind. You don\u2019t want two threads running in your head, one with the lies you tell \u2014and now have to keep track of\u2014and the other with the truth. If you are honest, you only have to think about one thing at a time, which frees up mental energy and makes you a clearer thinker.\nAlso, by being honest you\u2019re rejecting people who only want to hear pretty lies. You force those people out of your network. Sometimes it\u2019s painful, especially with friends and family. But over the long-term you create room for the people who like you exactly the way that you are. That is a selfish reason to be honest.\nIf you cut fair deals, you will get paid in the long run\nNegotiations offer another good example. If you\u2019re the kind of person who always tries to get the best deal for yourself, you will win a lot of early deals and it will feel very good.\nOn the other hand, a few people will recognize that you\u2019re always scrabbling and not acting fairly, and they will tend to avoid you. Over time those are the people who end up being the dealmakers in the network. People go to them for a fair shake or to figure out what\u2019s fair.\nIf you cut people fair deals, you won\u2019t get paid in the short-term. But over the long-term, everybody will want to deal with you. You end up being a market hub. You have more information. You have trust. You have a reputation. And people end up doing deals through you in the long-run.\nA lot of wisdom involves realizing long-term consequences of your actions. The longer your time horizon, the wiser you\u2019re going to seem to everybody around you.\nEnvy Can Be Useful, or It Can Eat You Alive\nEnvy can give you a powerful boost, or it can eat you alive\nSuffering through the wrong thing can motivate you to find the right thing\nNivi: Do you want to tell us about jobs you had growing up and the one that kicked off your fanatical obsession with creating wealth?\nNaval: This gets a little personal, and I don\u2019t want to humble-brag. There was a thread going around Twitter\u2014Name Five Jobs You\u2019ve Held\u2014and every rich person on there was signaling how they\u2019ve held normal jobs. I don\u2019t want to play that game.\nI\u2019ve had menial jobs. There are people who had it worse than me and people who had it better than me.\nAt one point in college I was washing dishes in the school cafeteria and said, \u201cF this. I hate this. I can\u2019t do this anymore.\u201d I sweet-talked may way into a teaching assistant job for a computer science professor, even though I was completely unqualified. The job forced me to learn computer algorithms, so I could TA the rest of the course.\nSo my desire to learn computer algorithms came out of the suffering I experienced washing dishes\u2014not that there\u2019s anything wrong with washing dishes; it just wasn\u2019t for me.\nI had an active mind. I wanted to make money and earn a living through mental activities, not through physical activities. Sometimes it takes suffering through the wrong thing to motivate you to find the right thing.\nBeing a lawyer was not what I was meant to do\nBack in the day I had a prestigious internship at a big New York City law firm. I basically got fired for surfing Usenet.\nThis was before the Internet was a big thing. Usenet hosted newsgroups, and it was the only the only thing keeping me from being completely bored. I was an overpaid intern wearing a suit and tie. I got to hang out in the conference room and make photocopies when lawyers needed them.\nI was bored out of my skull. This was pre-iPhone (thank God for Steve Jobs for saving us all from unending boredom). I used to read The Wall Street Journal or anything I could get my hands on. I would\u2019ve read the back of a brochure to keep from going insane, because listening to a bunch of corporate lawyers discuss how to optimize details of a contract is really dull.\nThey wanted me to sit there quietly and not read the paper. They got mad and said, \u201cThat\u2019s rude. That\u2019s misbehavior.\u201d\nI got called up and reprimanded a bunch of times. I was finally terminated\u2014sent home in shame from my prestigious internship, destroying my chance to go to law school.\nI was unhappy\u2026 for all of an hour. Ultimately, it\u2019s one of the best things that ever happened to me. Otherwise, I would have ended up a lawyer. Not that I have anything against lawyers; it\u2019s just not what I was meant to do.\nEnvy can be useful or it can eat you alive\nNivi: You mentioned a catering job that kicked off your obsession with wealth.\nNaval: That was an envy thing. When I was in high school, I needed a job to pay for my first semester of college.\nIt was the summer of 1990 or 1991. This was the Bush Senior recession\u2014if anyone listening was alive back then to remember it\u2014so it was actually really hard to get a job.\nI ended up working for a catering company serving Indian food. One day, I had to serve at a birthday party for a kid in my school. So I was out there serving food and drinks to all of my classmates. That was incredibly embarrassing. I wanted to hide away and die right there.\nBut you know what? It\u2019s all part of the plan. It\u2019s all part of the motivation. If that didn\u2019t happen, I probably wouldn\u2019t be as motivated or as successful. It\u2019s all fine. It was definitely a strong motivator.\nIn that sense, envy can be useful. Envy also can eat you alive if you let it follow you around your entire life. But there are points in your life when it can be a powerful booster rocket.\nPrincipal-Agent Problem: Act Like an Owner\nIf you think and act like an owner, it\u2019s only a matter of time until you become an owner\nA principal is an owner; an agent is an employee\nNivi: We spoke earlier about picking a business model that has leverage from scale economies, network effects and zero marginal cost of replication. There were a few other ideas on the cutting-room floor that I want to go through with you. The first one is the principal-agent problem.\nNaval: So mental models are all the rage. Everyone\u2019s trying to become smarter by adopting mental models. I think mental models are interesting, but I don\u2019t think explicitly in terms of mental-model checklists. I know Charlie Munger does, but that\u2019s just not how I think.\nInstead, I tend to focus on the few lessons I\u2019ve learned over and over in life that I think are incredibly important and seem to apply almost universally. One that keeps coming up from microeconomics\u2014because as we\u2019ve established, macroeconomics is not really worth spending time on\u2014is what\u2019s called the principal-agent problem.\nIn this case it\u2019s a principal, who is a person; rather than a principle that you would follow. A principal is an owner. An agent works for the owner, so you can think of an agent as an employee. The difference between a founder and an employee is the difference between a principal and an agent.\nA principal\u2019s incentives are different than an agent\u2019s incentives\nI can summarize the principal-agent problem with a famous quote attributed to Napoleon or Julius Caesar:\n\u201cIf you want it done, Go. If not, Send.\u201d\nWhich is to say: If you want to do something right, do it yourself; because other people just don\u2019t care enough.\nNow, the principal-agent problem pops up everywhere. In microeconomics, they try to characterize it this way: The principal\u2019s incentives are different than the agent\u2019s incentives, so the owner of the business wants what is best for the business and will make the most money. The agent generally wants whatever will look good to the principal, or might make them the most friends in the neighborhood or in the business, or might make them personally the most money.\nYou see this a lot with hired-gun CEOs running public companies, where the ownership of the public company is distributed so widely that there\u2019s no principal remaining. Nobody owns more than 1% of the company. The CEO takes charge, stuffs the board with their buddies and then starts issuing themself low-price stock options, or doing a lot of stock buybacks because their compensation is based directly tied to the stock price.\nIf you can work on incentives, don\u2019t work on anything else\nAgents have a way of hacking systems. This is what make incentive design so difficult. As Charlie Munger says, if you could be working on incentives, don\u2019t work on anything else.\nAlmost all human behavior can be explained by incentives. The study of signaling is seeing what people do despite what they say. People are much more honest with their actions than they are with their words. You have to get the incentives right to get people to behave correctly. It\u2019s a very difficult problem because people aren\u2019t coin-operated. The good ones are not just looking for money\u2014they\u2019re also looking for things like status and meaning in what they do.\nAs a business owner you are always going to be dealing with the principal-agent problem. You\u2019re always going to be trying to figure out: How do I make this person think like me? How do I incent them? How do I give them founder mentality?\nOnly founders can fully appreciate the importance of a founder mentality and just how difficult and gnarly principal-agent problem is.\nWhen you do deals, it\u2019s better to have the same incentives\nIf you are a principal, you want to spend a lot of your time thinking about this problem. You want to be generous with your top lieutenants\u2014in terms of ownership and incentives\u2014even if they don\u2019t necessarily realize it; because over time they will and you want them to be aligned with you.\nWhen you do business deals, it\u2019s better to have an aligned partnership where you both have the same incentives than a partnership where you have the advantage in the deal. Because eventually the other person will figure it and the partnership will fall apart. Either way, it\u2019s not going to be one of those things that you can invest in and enjoy the benefits of compound interest over decades.\nIf you\u2019re an employee, your most important job is to think like a principal\nFinally, if you\u2019re in a role where you\u2019re an agent\u2014you\u2019re an employee\u2014then your most important job is to think like a principal. The more you can think like a principal, the better off you\u2019re going to be long-term. Train yourself how to think like a principal, and eventually you will become a principal. If you align yourself with a good principal, they will promote you or empower you or give you accountability or leverage that may be way out of proportion to your relatively menial role.\nI\u2019m always impressed by founders who promote young people through the ranks and allow them to skip multiple levels despite their lack of experience. Invariably it happens because this agent\u2014who\u2019s way deep down in the organization\u2014thinks like a principal.\nIf you can hack your way through the principal-agent problem, you\u2019ll probably solve half of what it takes to run a company.\nNivi: The reason I asked about this one first is because I feel like I never see the principal-agent problem in my work. I tend to work in small teams where everybody is highly economically aligned, and the people have been filtered for a commitment to the mission, and everybody else who doesn\u2019t work out moves on to another role elsewhere.\nNaval: These are all heuristics that you have designed to avoid having to deal with the single biggest problem in management.\nDeal with small firms to avoid the principal-agent problem\nAnother example of a heuristic that helps you route around the principal-agent problem is to deal with the smallest firms possible. For example, when I hire a lawyer or a banker or even an accountant to work on my deals, I\u2019ve become very cognizant about the size of the firm. Bigger firms\u2014all other things being equal\u2014are generally worse than small ones.\nYes, the big firm has more experience. Yes, they have more people. Yes, they have a bigger brand. But you\u2019ll find the principal and the agent are highly separated. Very often the principal will sell you and convince you to work with the firm, but then all the work will be done by an agent who simply doesn\u2019t care as much. You end up getting substandard service.\nI prefer to work with boutiques. My ideal law firm is a law firm of one. My ideal banker is a solo banker. Now, you\u2019re making other sacrifices and trade-offs in terms of that person\u2019s resources\u2014and you are betting big on that person. But you\u2019ve got one throat to choke. There\u2019s no one else to point fingers at; there\u2019s nowhere to run. The accountability is extremely high.\nIf you are an agent, the best way to operate is to ask, \u201cWhat would the founder do?\u201d If you think like the owner and you act like the owner, it\u2019s only a matter of time until you become the owner.\nKelly Criterion: Avoid Ruin\nDon\u2019t ruin your reputation or get wiped to zero\nDon\u2019t bet everything on one big gamble\nNivi: Let\u2019s chat about the Kelly criterion.\nNaval: The Kelly criterion is a popularized mathematical formulation of a simple concept. The simple concept is: Don\u2019t risk everything. Stay out of jail. Don\u2019t bet everything on one big gamble. Be careful how much you bet each time, so you don\u2019t lose the whole kitty.\nIf you\u2019re a gambler, the Kelly criterion mathematically formulates how much you should wager per hand, even if you have an edge\u2014because even when you have an edge, you can still lose. Let\u2019s say you have 51-to-49 edge. Every gambler knows not to bet the whole kitty on that 51-to-49 edge\u2014because you could lose everything and won\u2019t get to come back to the average.\nNassim Taleb famously talks about ergodicity, which is a fancy word for a simple concept: What is true for 100 people on average isn\u2019t the same as one person averaging that same thing 100 times.\nRuining your reputation is the same as getting wiped to zero\nThe easiest way to see that is with Russian roulette. Say six people play Russian roulette one time each, and each winner gets $1 billion. One person ends up dead and five people get $1 billion. Compare that to one person playing Russian roulette six times with the same gun. They are never going to end up a billionaire\u2014they will be dead and worth zero. So risk-taking\u2014especially when the averages that are calculated across large populations\u2014is not always rational.\nThe Kelly criterion helps you avoid ruin. The number one way people get ruined in modern business is not by betting too much; it\u2019s by cutting corners and doing unethical or downright illegal things. Ending up in an orange jumpsuit in prison or having a reputation ruined is the same as getting wiped to zero\u2014so never do those things.\nSchelling Point: Cooperating Without Communicating\nPeople who can\u2019t communicate can cooperate by anticipating the other person\u2019s actions\nUse social norms to cooperate when you can\u2019t communicate\nNivi: Let\u2019s talk about Schelling points.\nNaval: The Schelling point is a game theory concept made famous by Thomas Schelling in his book, The Strategy of Conflict, which I recommend.\nIt\u2019s about multiplayer games where people respond based on what they think the other person\u2019s response will be. He came up with a mathematical formalization to answer: How do you get people who cannot communicate with each other to coordinate?\nSuppose I want to meet with you, but I don\u2019t tell you where or when to meet. You also want to meet with me, but we can\u2019t communicate. That sounds like an impossible problem to solve\u2014we can\u2019t do it. But not quite.\nYou can use social norms to converge on a Schelling point. I know you\u2019re rational and educated. And you know I\u2019m rational and educated. We\u2019re both going to start thinking.\nWhen will we meet? If we have to pick an arbitrary date, we\u2019ll probably pick New Year\u2019s Eve. What time will we meet? Midnight or 12:01 a.m. Where will we meet? If we\u2019re Americans, the big meeting spot is probably New York City, the most important city. Where in New York City will we meet? Probably under the clock at Grand Central Station. Maybe you end up at the Empire State Building, but not likely.\nYou can find Schelling points in business, art and politics\nThere are many games\u2014whether it\u2019s business or art or politics\u2014where you can find a Schelling point. So you can cooperate with the other person, even when you can\u2019t communicate.\nHere\u2019s a simple example: Suppose two companies are competing heavily and hold an oligopoly. Let\u2019s say the price fluctuates between $8 and $12 for whatever the service is. Don\u2019t be surprised if they converge on $10 without ever talking to each other.\nTurn Short-Term Games Into Long-Term Games\nImprove your leverage by turning short-term relationships into long-term ones\nPareto optimal solutions require a trade-off to improve any criterion\nNivi: Do you want to talk about Pareto optimal?\nNaval: Pareto optimal is another concept from game theory, along with Pareto superior.\nPareto superior means something is better in some ways while being equal or better in other ways. It\u2019s not worse in any way. This is an important concept when you\u2019re negotiating. If you can make a solution Pareto superior to where it was before, you will always do that.\nPareto optimal is when the solution is the best it can possibly be and you can\u2019t change it without making it worse in at least one dimension. There is a hard trade-off from this point forward.\nThese are important concepts to understand when you\u2019re involved in a big negotiation.\nNegotiations are won by whoever cares less\nI generally say, though: \u201cNegotiations are won by whoever cares less.\u201d Negotiation is about not wanting it too badly. If you want something too badly, the other person can extract more value from you.\nIf someone is taking advantage of you in a negotiation, your best option is to turn it from a short-term game into a long-term game. Try to make it a repeat game. Try to bring reputation into the negotiation. Try to include other people who may want to play games with this person in the future.\nAn example of a high-cost, low-information single-move game is having your house renovated.\nContractors are notorious for overbooking, ripping people off, and being unaccountable. I\u2019m sure contractors have their own side to it: \u201cThe homeowner has unreasonable demands.\u201d \u201cWe found problems.\u201d \u201cThe homeowner doesn\u2019t want to pay for it.\u201d \u201cThey don\u2019t understand; they\u2019re low-information buyers.\u201d\nIt\u2019s an expensive transaction. Historically it\u2019s been very hard to find good contractors; and the contractor has little information on the homeowner.\nConvert single-move games to multi-move games\nSo you try to go through friends. You try to find people with good reputations. You\u2019re converting an expensive single-move game with a high probability of cheating on both sides into a multi-move game.\nOne way to do that is to say: \u201cActually, I need two different projects done. The first project we\u2019ll do together, and based on that I\u2019ll decide if we do the second project.\u201d\nAnother way is to say: \u201cI\u2019m going to do this project with you, and I have three friends who want projects done who are waiting to see the outcome of this project.\u201d\nAnother way is to write a Yelp or Thumbtack review\u2014especially if the contractor operates within a community and wants to protect their reputation in that community.\nThese are all ways to turn a single-move game into a longer term game and get past a position of poor negotiating leverage and poor information.\nCompounding Relationships Make Life Easier\nLife gets a lot easier when you know someone\u2019s got your back\nMutual trust makes it easy to do business\nRelationships offer a good example of compound interest. Once you\u2019ve been in a good relationship with somebody for a while\u2014whether it\u2019s business or romantic\u2014life gets a lot easier because you know that person\u2019s got your back. You don\u2019t have to keep questioning.\nIf I\u2019m doing a deal with someone I\u2019ve worked with for 20 years and there is mutual trust, we don\u2019t have to read the legal contracts. Maybe we don\u2019t even need to create legal contracts; maybe we can do it with a handshake. That kind of trust makes it very easy to do business.\nIf Nivi and I start another company and things aren\u2019t working out, I know we\u2019re both going to be extremely reasonable about deciding what to do\u2014how to exit or shut it down. Or if we\u2019re scaling it, how to bring in new people. We have mutual trust, and that allows us to start businesses more easily and compounds the effect.\nThe most under-recognized reason startups fail is because the founders fall apart.\nA startup is so difficult to pull off, so removing potential friction points between founders can be the difference between success and failure.\nIt\u2019s better to have a few compounding relationships than many shallow ones\nNivi: There are a couple of non-intuitive things about compounding. The first is that most of the benefits come at the end, so you may not see huge benefits up front.\nSam Altman wrote, \u201cI always want it to be a project that, if successful, will make the rest of my career look like a footnote.\u201d Again, most of the benefits of compounding come at the end.\nAnother thing that\u2019s non-intuitive about compounding: It\u2019s better to have a few deep compounding relationships than many shallow, non-compounding relationships.\nIt takes just as much effort to create a small business as a large one\nNaval: One thing about business that people don\u2019t realize: it takes just as much effort to create a small business as it does to create a large one.\nWhether you\u2019re Elon Musk or the guy running three Italian restaurants in town, you\u2019re working 80 hours a week; you\u2019re sweating bullets; you\u2019re hiring and firing people; you\u2019re trying to balance the books; it\u2019s highly stressful; and it takes years and years of your life.\nIn one case, you get companies worth $50-$100 billion and everyone\u2019s adulation. In the other, you might make a little bit of money and you\u2019ve got some nice restaurants. So think big.\nPrice Discrimination: Charge Some People More\nYou can charge people for extras based on their propensity to pay\nPrice discrimination is a technique for charging certain people more\nNivi: Are there any other microeconomic concepts, outside of zero marginal cost of replication and scale economies, that are important to understand?\nNaval: Price discrimination is important. It means you can charge people based on their propensity to pay.\nNow, you can\u2019t charge people different amounts just because you don\u2019t like them. You have to offer them something extra. But it has to be something rich people care about.\nBusiness-class seats routinely cost five or 10 times more than economy seats. But it costs the airline much less\u2014maybe two or three times more than a standard seat\u2014to provide perks like wider seats, more legroom and free drinks.\nRich people and large enterprises are willing to pay more\nPrice discrimination works because rich people are willing to pay more. You just have to give them the extra little things they need to signal they\u2019re rich or that little bit of comfort they want.\nA lot of enterprise software companies use price discrimination, especially with freemium products. The free or low-price version will do almost everything you want. But if you want the version that\u2019s extra secure or hosted on your site or has multiple-user administration so the IT person can monitor everything, you\u2019ll find yourself paying 10 or 100 times more.\nConsumer Surplus: Getting More Than You Paid For\nPeople are willing to pay more than what companies charge\nConsumer surplus is the extra value you get when you pay less than you were willing\nNaval: Consumer surplus and producer surplus are important concepts. Consumer surplus is the excess value you get from something when you pay less than you were willing to pay.\nI get a lot of joy out of my morning Starbucks coffee. Obviously I\u2019ve made some money. So if my coffee cost $20, I would pay it.\nBut Starbucks doesn\u2019t know that. They can\u2019t price the coffee at $20 just for me, because they\u2019re selling the exact same product to others. So I\u2019m getting a lot of consumer surplus out of the coffee.\nAll businesses generate consumer surplus. It\u2019s a good thing to keep in mind when someone\u2019s harping on about how evil companies are. Amazon might be a trillion-dollar company, but I\u2019ll bet they\u2019re generating trillions of dollars in consumer surplus through people\u2019s willingness to pay for convenience. A lot of people are willing to pay more than what Amazon charges.\nNet Present Value: What Future Income Is Worth Today\nSee what future income is worth today by applying a discount to its future value\nFigure out what future income is worth today by applying a discount rate\nNivi: Let\u2019s talk about net present value (NPV).\nNaval: Net present value is when you say, \u201cThat stream of payments I\u2019m going to get in the future\u2014what\u2019s it worth today?\u201d\nHere\u2019s a common example: You\u2019re joining a startup and getting stock options, and the founder says, \u201cThis company is going to be worth $1 billion, and I\u2019m giving you 0.1% of the company; therefore, you\u2019re getting $1 million worth of stock.\u201d\nThe founder is negotiating based on what it\u2019s going to be worth in the future. You have to figure out what it\u2019s worth today by applying a discount rate, or an interest rate, that accounts for the massive risk startups face.\nYou\u2019ll end up with the amount the company is actually worth today. That\u2019s the price at which a venture capitalist would invest in the company.\nIf the founder recently raised a round at a $10 million valuation, then the company\u2019s only worth 1% of what the founder says it will be worth. So your $1 million package is actually worth $10,000. You should get very comfortable doing rough net present value calculations in your head.\nExternalities: Calculating the Hidden Costs of Products\nExternalities let you account for the true cost of products by including hidden costs\nNivi: What\u2019s a mispriced externality? You mentioned it on a previous episode.\nNaval: An externality is where there\u2019s an additional cost imposed by whatever product is being produced or consumed, that\u2019s not accounted for in the price of the product. This can happen for many reasons. Sometimes you can fix it by putting the cost back into the price.\nSome of the most ardent critics of capitalism argue it\u2019s destroying the environment. If you throw away capitalism because it\u2019s destroying the environment, then guess what\u2014we\u2019re all headed back to pre-industrial times. That\u2019s not going to be a good thing.\nPricing externalities properly is more effective than feel-good measures\nBecause the environment is finite and precious, we have to price it properly and fold that back into the cost of products and services.\nIf people are wasting water, releasing hydrocarbons into the atmosphere or polluting in other ways, society should charge them what it costs to clean up the pollution and return the environment to a pristine state. Perhaps that price has to be very, very, very high.\nIf you raise the price high enough, you\u2019ll knock out pollution. That\u2019s much better than feel-good measures like banning plastic bags or restricting showers during a drought.\nProperly pricing externalities can save resources in a tremendous way\nCalifornia likes to run declarations and ads to scare people into avoiding showers during droughts. It would be better to raise the price of fresh water. The average consumer might pay a few pennies more for a shower, but the almond farmers\u2014who consume a lot of water\u2014will cut back; and almond farming may move to a part of the country where water is more abundant.\nProperly pricing externalities can save resources in a tremendous way. It\u2019s a good framework to use when you want to do things like save the environment, rather than doing feel-good things that won\u2019t actually amount to anything.\nBonus: Finding Time to Invest in Yourself\nIf you have to work a \u201cnormal job,\u201d take on accountability to build your specific knowledge\nNivi: A common question we get: \u201cHow do I find the time to start investing in myself? I have a job.\u201d\nYou have to rent your time to get started\nIn one of the tweets from the cutting room floor, you wrote: \u201cYou will need to rent your time to get started. This is only acceptable when you are learning and saving. Preferably in a business where society does not yet know how to train people and apprenticeship is the only model.\u201d\nNaval: Try to learn something that people haven\u2019t quite figured out how to teach yet. That can happen if you\u2019re working in a new and quickly expanding field. It\u2019s also common in fields that are circumstantial\u2014where the details matter and it\u2019s always moving. Investing is one of those fields; so is entrepreneurship.\nChief of staff for a founder is one of the most coveted jobs for young people starting out in Silicon Valley. The brightest kids will follow an entrepreneur around and do whatever he or she needs them to do.\nIn many cases, the person is way overqualified. Someone with multiple graduate degrees might be running the CEO\u2019s laundry because that\u2019s the most important thing at the moment.\nAt the same time, that person gets to attend the most important meetings. They are privy to all the stress and theatrics, the fundraising decks and the innovation\u2014knowledge that can only come from being in the room.\nComing out of college, Warren Buffett wanted to work for Benjamin Graham to learn to be a value investor. Buffett offered to work for free, and Graham responded, \u201cYou\u2019re overpriced.\u201d What that means is you have to make sacrifices to take on an apprenticeship.\nFind the part of the job with the steepest learning curve\nIf can\u2019t learn in an apprenticeship model because you need to make money, try to be innovative in the context of your job. Take on new challenges and responsibilities. Find the part of the job with the steepest learning curve.\nYou want to avoid repetitive drudgery\u2014that\u2019s just biding time until your job is automated away.\nIf you\u2019re a barista at the coffee shop, figure out how to make connections with the customers. Figure out how to innovate the service you offer and delight the customer. Managers, founders and owners will take notice.\nDevelop a founder mentality\nThe hardest thing for any founder is finding employees with a founder mentality. This is a fancy way of saying they care enough.\nPeople will say, \u201cWell, I\u2019m not the founder. I\u2019m not being paid enough to care.\u201d Actually, you are: The knowledge and skills you gain by developing a founder mentality set you up to be a founder down the line; that\u2019s your compensation.\nYou can get a lot out of almost any position. You just have to put a lot into it.\nAccountability is something you can take on immediately\nNivi: We\u2019ve discussed accountability, judgment, specific knowledge and leverage. If I\u2019m working a \u201cnormal\u201d job, is specific knowledge the one I should focus on?\nNaval: Judgment takes experience. It takes a lot of time to build up. You have to put yourself in positions where you can exercise judgment. That\u2019ll come from taking on accountability.\nLeverage is something that society gives you after you\u2019ve demonstrated judgment. You can get it faster by learning high-leverage skills like coding or working with the media. These are permissionless leverage. This is why I encourage people to learn to code or produce media, even if it\u2019s just nights and weekends.\nSo, judgment and leverage tend to come later. Accountability is something you can take on immediately. You can say, \u201cHey, I\u2019ll take charge of this thing that nobody wants to take charge of.\u201d When you take on accountability, you\u2019re also publicly putting your neck on the chopping block\u2014so you have to deliver.\nYou build specific knowledge by taking accountability for things that other people don\u2019t know how to do. Perhaps they\u2019re things you enjoy doing or are naturally inclined towards doing anyway.\nIf you work in a factory, the hardest thing may be raising capital to keep the factory running. Maybe that\u2019s what the owner is always stressed out about.\nYou might notice this and think, \u201cI\u2019m good at balancing my checkbook and have a good head for numbers; but I haven\u2019t raised money before.\u201d You offer to help and become the owner\u2019s sidekick solving their fundraising problem. If you have a natural aptitude and take on accountability, you can put yourself in a position to learn quickly. Before long, you\u2019ll become the heir apparent.\nEarly on, find things that interest you and allow you to take on accountability. Don\u2019t worry about short-term compensation. Compensation comes when you\u2019re tired of waiting for it and have given up on it. This is the way the whole system works.\nIf you take on accountability and solve problems on the edge of knowledge that others can\u2019t solve, people will line up behind you. The leverage will come.\nSpecific knowledge can be timely or timeless\nThere are two forms of specific knowledge: timely and timeless.\nIf you become a world-class expert in machine learning just as it takes off and you got there through genuine intellectual interest, you\u2019re going to do really well. But 20 years from now, machine learning may be second hat; the world may have moved on to something else. That\u2019s timely knowledge.\nIf you\u2019re good at persuading people, it\u2019s probably a skill you picked up early on in life. It\u2019s always going to apply, because persuading people is always going to be valuable. That\u2019s timeless knowledge.\nNow, persuasion is a generic skill\u2014it\u2019s probably not enough to build a career on. You need to combine it in a skill stack, as Scott Adams writes. You might combine persuasion with accounting and an understanding of semiconductor production lines. Now you can become the best semiconductor salesperson and, later on, the best semiconductor company CEO.\nTimeless specific knowledge usually can\u2019t be taught, and it sticks with you forever. Timely specific knowledge comes and goes; but it tends to have a fairly long shelf life.\nTechnology is a good place to find those timely skills sets. If you can bring in a more generic specialized knowledge skill set from the outside, then you\u2019ve got gold.\nTechnology is an intellectual frontier for gaining specific knowledge\nNivi: There were a couple other tweets from the cutting-room floor on this topic. The first: \u201cThe technology industry is a great place to acquire specific knowledge. The frontier is always moving forward. If you are genuinely intellectually curious, you will acquire the knowledge ahead of others.\u201d\nNaval: Danny Hillis famously said technology is everything that doesn\u2019t work yet. Technology is around us everywhere. The spoon was technology once; fire was technology once. When we figured out how to make them work, they disappeared in the background and became part of our everyday lives.\nTechnology is, by definition, the intellectual frontier. It\u2019s taking things from science and culture that we have not figured out how to mass produce or create efficiently and figuring out how to commercialize it and make it available to everybody.\nTechnology will always be a great field where you can pick up specific knowledge that is valuable to society.\nIf you don\u2019t have accountability, do something different\nNivi: Here\u2019s another tweet from the cutting-room floor related to accountability: \u201cCompanies don\u2019t know how to measure outputs, so they measure inputs instead. Work in a way that your outputs are visible and measurable. If you don\u2019t have accountability, do something different.\u201d\nNaval: The entire structure of rewarding people comes from the agricultural and industrial ages, when inputs and outputs matched up closely. The amount of hours you put into doing something was a reliable proxy for what kind of output you\u2019d get.\nToday, it\u2019s extremely nonlinear. One good investment decision can make a company $10 million or $100 million. One good product feature can be the difference between product-market fit and complete failure.\nAs a result, judgment and accountability matter much more. Often the best engineers aren\u2019t the hardest workers. Sometimes they don\u2019t work very hard at all, but they dependably ship that one critical product at just the right time. It\u2019s similar to the salesperson who closes the huge deal that makes the company\u2019s numbers for the quarter.\nPeople need to be able to tell what role you had in the company\u2019s success. That doesn\u2019t mean stomping all over your team\u2014people are extremely sensitive to others taking too much credit. You always want to be giving out credit. Smart people will know who was responsible.\nSome jobs are too removed from the customer for this type of accountability. You\u2019re just a cog in a machine.\nConsulting is a good example. As a consultant, your ideas are delivered through someone else within the organization. You may not have visibility to the top people; you may be hidden behind a screen. That\u2019s a trade-off you\u2019re making in exchange for your independence.\nYou\u2019ll develop thick-skin if you take on accountability\nWhen you have accountability, you get a lot more credit when things go right. Of course, the downside is you get hurt a lot more when things go wrong. When you stick your neck out, you have to be willing to be blamed, sacrificed and even attacked.\nIf you\u2019re the kind of person who thrives in a high-accountability environment, you\u2019re going to end up thick-skinned over time. You\u2019re going to get hurt a lot. People are going to attack you if you fail.\nScale your specific knowledge with apprentices\nNivi: Once you get some specific knowledge, you can scale it by training your own apprentices and outsourcing tasks to them.\nNaval: For example, I made good investments and figured out the venture business. I could have kept doing that and making money. Instead, I co-founded Spearhead to train up-and-coming founders to become angels and venture investors. We give them a checkbook to start investing.\nIt\u2019s an apprenticeship model. They come to us with deals they\u2019re looking at, and we help them think it through. This model is more scalable than my personal investing.\nSpecific knowledge comes on the job, not in a classroom\nAt Spearhead we lead classes teaching founders about investing, and we also hold office hours to discuss specific deals they bring.\nIt turns out the classes and talks we lead are largely worthless. You can give all the generic advice people need in about an hour. After that, the advice gets so circumstantial that it essentially cancels to zero. But the office hours are incredibly useful.\nThis reinforces the notion that investing is one of those skills that can only be learned on the job. When you find a skill like that, you\u2019re dealing with specific knowledge.\nAnother good indicator of specific knowledge is when someone can\u2019t give a straight answer to the question: \u201cWhat do you do every day?\u201d Or you get an answer along the lines of, \u201cEvery day is different based on what\u2019s going on.\u201d\nThe thing is so complicated and dependent upon circumstances that it can\u2019t be boiled down into a textbook form.\nNivi: The mafia figured out this apprenticeship model a long time ago. The best way to end up running one of the families was to become the driver for the Don.\nNaval: Tony Soprano was a businessman who had to enforce his own contracts. That\u2019s a very complicated business.\nThis transcript has been edited for clarity.", "sentiment": 0.884, "pageUrl": "https://nav.al/rich", "date": "Fri, 27 Dec 2019 23:00:00 GMT", "person": "naval_ravikant"}, {"title": "Externalities: Calculating the Hidden Costs of Products", "text": "Nivi: What\u2019s a mispriced externality?

It\u2019s not worse in any way. This is an important concept when you\u2019re negotiating. If you can make a solution Pareto superior to where it was before, you will always do that.\nPareto optimal solutions require a trade-off to improve any criterion\nPareto optimal is when the solution is the best it can possibly be and you can\u2019t change it without making it worse in at least one dimension. There is a hard trade-off from this point forward.\nThese are important concepts to understand when you\u2019re involved in a big negotiation.\nNegotiations are won by whoever cares less\nI generally say, though: \u201cNegotiations are won by whoever cares less.\u201d Negotiation is about not wanting it too badly. If you want something too badly, the other person can extract more value from you.\nIf someone is taking advantage of you in a negotiation, your best option is to turn it from a short-term game into a long-term game. Try to make it a repeat game. Try to bring reputation into the negotiation. Try to include other people who may want to play games with this person in the future.\nAn example of a high-cost, low-information single-move game is having your house renovated.\nContractors are notorious for overbooking, ripping people off, and being unaccountable.

He came up with a mathematical formalization to answer: How do you get people who cannot communicate with each other to coordinate?\nUse social norms to cooperate when you can\u2019t communicate\nSuppose I want to meet with you, but I don\u2019t tell you where or when to meet. You also want to meet with me, but we can\u2019t communicate. That sounds like an impossible problem to solve\u2014we can\u2019t do it.

Midnight or 12:01 a.m. Where will we meet? If we\u2019re Americans, the big meeting spot is probably New York City, the most important city. Where in New York City will we meet? Probably under the clock at Grand Central Station. Maybe you end up at the Empire State Building, but not likely.\nYou can find Schelling points in business, art and politics\nThere are many games\u2014whether it\u2019s business or art or politics\u2014where you can find a Schelling point. So you can cooperate with the other person, even when you can\u2019t communicate.\nHere\u2019s a simple example: Suppose two companies are competing heavily and hold an oligopoly. Let\u2019s say the price fluctuates between $8 and $12 for whatever the service is. Don\u2019t be surprised if they converge on $10 without ever talking to each other.", "sentiment": 0.21, "pageUrl": "https://nav.al/schelling-point", "date": "Thu, 11 Jul 2019 23:00:00 GMT", "person": "naval_ravikant"}, {"title": "Principal-Agent Problem: Act Like an Owner", "text": "Nivi: We spoke earlier about picking a business model that has leverage from scale economies, network effects and zero marginal cost of replication. There were a few other ideas on the cutting-room floor that I want to go through with you. The first one is the principal-agent problem.\nNaval: So mental models are all the rage. Everyone\u2019s trying to become smarter by adopting mental models. I think mental models are interesting, but I don\u2019t think explicitly in terms of mental-model checklists. I know Charlie Munger does, but that\u2019s just not how I think.\nA principal is an owner; an agent is an employee\nInstead, I tend to focus on the few lessons I\u2019ve learned over and over in life that I think are incredibly important and seem to apply almost universally. One that keeps coming up from microeconomics\u2014because as we\u2019ve established, macroeconomics is not really worth spending time on\u2014is what\u2019s called the principal-agent problem.\nIn this case it\u2019s a principal, who is a person; rather than a principle that you would follow. A principal is an owner. An agent works for the owner, so you can think of an agent as an employee. The difference between a founder and an employee is the difference between a principal and an agent.\nI can summarize the principal-agent problem with a famous quote attributed to Napoleon or Julius Caesar: \u201cIf you want it done, Go. If not, Send.\u201d\nWhich is to say: If you want to do something right, do it yourself; because other people just don\u2019t care enough.\nA principal\u2019s incentives are different than an agent\u2019s incentives\nNow, the principal-agent problem pops up everywhere. In microeconomics, they try to characterize it this way: The principal\u2019s incentives are different than the agent\u2019s incentives, so the owner of the business wants what is best for the business and will make the most money. The agent generally wants whatever will look good to the principal, or might make them the most friends in the neighborhood or in the business, or might make them personally the most money.\nYou see this a lot with hired-gun CEOs running public companies, where the ownership of the public company is distributed so widely that there\u2019s no principal remaining. Nobody owns more than 1% of the company. The CEO takes charge, stuffs the board with their buddies and then starts issuing themselves low-priced stock options, or doing a lot of stock buybacks because their compensation is based directly tied to the stock price.\nIf you can work on incentives, don\u2019t work on anything else\nAgents have a way of hacking systems. This is what makes incentive design so difficult. As Charlie Munger says, \u201cNever, ever, think about something else when you should be thinking about the power of incentives.\u201d\nAlmost all human behavior can be explained by incentives. The study of signaling is seeing what people do despite what they say. People are much more honest with their actions than they are with their words. You have to get the incentives right to get people to behave correctly. It\u2019s a very difficult problem because people aren\u2019t coin-operated. The good ones are not just looking for money\u2014they\u2019re also looking for status and meaning in what they do.\nAs a business owner you are always going to be dealing with the principal-agent problem. You\u2019re always going to be trying to figure out: How do I make this person think like me? How do I incent them? How do I give them founder mentality?\nOnly founders can fully appreciate the importance of founder mentality and just how difficult and gnarly the principal-agent problem is.\nWhen you do deals, it\u2019s better to have the same incentives\nIf you are a principal, you want to spend a lot of your time thinking about this problem. You want to be generous with your top lieutenants\u2014in terms of ownership and incentives\u2014even if they don\u2019t necessarily realize it; because over time they will and you want them to be aligned with you.\nWhen you do business deals, it\u2019s better to have an aligned partnership where you both have the same incentives than a partnership where you have the advantage in the deal. Because eventually the other person will figure it and the partnership will fall apart. Either way, it\u2019s not going to be one of those things that you can invest in and enjoy the benefits of compound interest over decades.\nIf you\u2019re an employee, your most important job is to think like a principal\nFinally, if you\u2019re in a role where you\u2019re an agent\u2014you\u2019re an employee\u2014then your most important job is to think like a principal. The more you can think like a principal, the better off you\u2019re going to be long-term. Train yourself how to think like a principal, and eventually you will become a principal. If you align yourself with a good principal, they will promote you or empower you or give you accountability or leverage that may be way out of proportion to your relatively menial role.\nI\u2019m always impressed by founders who promote young people through the ranks and allow them to skip multiple levels despite their lack of experience. Invariably it happens because this agent\u2014who\u2019s way deep down in the organization\u2014thinks like a principal.\nIf you can hack your way through the principal-agent problem, you\u2019ll probably solve half of what it takes to run a company.\nNivi: The reason I asked about this one first is because I feel like I never see the principal-agent problem in my work. I tend to work in small teams where everybody is highly economically aligned, and the people have been filtered for a commitment to the mission, and everybody else who doesn\u2019t work out moves on to another role elsewhere.\nNaval: These are all heuristics that you have designed to avoid having to deal with the single biggest problem in management.\nDeal with small firms to avoid the principal-agent problem\nAnother example of a heuristic that helps you route around the principal-agent problem is to deal with the smallest firms possible. For example, when I hire a lawyer or a banker or even an accountant to work on my deals, I\u2019ve become very cognizant about the size of the firm. Bigger firms\u2014all other things being equal\u2014are generally worse than small ones.\nYes, the big firm has more experience. Yes, they have more people. Yes, they have a bigger brand. But you\u2019ll find the principal and the agent are highly separated. Very often the principal will sell you and convince you to work with the firm, but then all the work will be done by an agent who simply doesn\u2019t care as much. You end up getting substandard service.\nI prefer to work with boutiques. My ideal law firm is a law firm of one. My ideal banker is a solo banker. Now, you\u2019re making other sacrifices and trade-offs in terms of that person\u2019s resources\u2014and you are betting big on that person. But you\u2019ve got one throat to choke. There\u2019s no one else to point fingers at; there\u2019s nowhere to run. The accountability is extremely high.\nIf you are an agent, the best way to operate is to ask, \u201cWhat would the founder do?\u201d If you think like the owner and you act like the owner, it\u2019s only a matter of time until you become the owner.\nRelated", "sentiment": -0.566, "pageUrl": "https://nav.al/principal-agent", "date": "Sun, 07 Jul 2019 23:00:00 GMT", "person": "naval_ravikant"}, {"title": "Envy Can Be Useful, or It Can Eat You Alive", "text": "Nivi: Do you want to tell us about jobs you had growing up and the one that kicked off your fanatical obsession with creating wealth?\nNaval: This gets a little personal, and I don\u2019t want to humble-brag. There was a thread going around Twitter\u2014Name Five Jobs You\u2019ve Held\u2014and every rich person on there was signaling how they\u2019ve held normal jobs. I don\u2019t want to play that game.\nI\u2019ve had menial jobs. There are people who had it worse than me and people who had it better than me.\nSuffering through the wrong thing can motivate you to find the right thing\nAt one point in college I was washing dishes in the school cafeteria and said, \u201cF this. I hate this. I can\u2019t do this anymore.\u201d I sweet-talked may way into a teaching assistant job for a computer science professor, even though I was completely unqualified. The job forced me to learn computer algorithms, so I could TA the rest of the course.\nSo my desire to learn computer algorithms came out of the suffering I experienced washing dishes\u2014not that there\u2019s anything wrong with washing dishes; it just wasn\u2019t for me.\nI had an active mind. I wanted to make money and earn a living through mental activities, not through physical activities. Sometimes it takes suffering through the wrong thing to motivate you to find the right thing.\nBeing a lawyer was not what I was meant to do\nBack in the day I had a prestigious internship at a big New York City law firm. I basically got fired for surfing Usenet.\nThis was before the Internet was a big thing. Usenet hosted newsgroups, and it was the only the only thing keeping me from being completely bored. I was an overpaid intern wearing a suit and tie. I got to hang out in the conference room and make photocopies when lawyers needed them.\nI was bored out of my skull. This was pre-iPhone (thank God for Steve Jobs for saving us all from unending boredom). I used to read The Wall Street Journal or anything I could get my hands on. I would\u2019ve read the back of a brochure to keep from going insane, because listening to a bunch of corporate lawyers discuss how to optimize details of a contract is really dull.\nThey wanted me to sit there quietly and not read the paper. They got mad and said, \u201cThat\u2019s rude. That\u2019s misbehavior.\u201d\nI got called up and reprimanded a bunch of times. I was finally terminated\u2014sent home in shame from my prestigious internship, destroying my chance to go to law school.\nI was unhappy\u2026 for all of an hour. Ultimately, it\u2019s one of the best things that ever happened to me. Otherwise, I would have ended up a lawyer. Not that I have anything against lawyers; it\u2019s just not what I was meant to do.\nEnvy can be a powerful booster, if it doesn\u2019t eat you alive\nNivi: You mentioned a catering job that kicked off your obsession with wealth.\nNaval: That was an envy thing. When I was in high school, I needed a job to pay for my first semester of college.\nIt was the summer of 1990 or 1991. This was the Bush Senior recession\u2014if anyone listening was alive back then to remember it\u2014so it was actually really hard to get a job.\nI ended up working for a catering company serving Indian food. One day, I had to serve at a birthday party for a kid in my school. So I was out there serving food and drinks to all of my classmates. That was incredibly embarrassing. I wanted to hide away and die right there.\nBut you know what? It\u2019s all part of the plan. It\u2019s all part of the motivation. If that didn\u2019t happen, I probably wouldn\u2019t be as motivated or as successful. It\u2019s all fine. It was definitely a strong motivator.\nIn that sense, envy can be useful. Envy also can eat you alive if you let it follow you around your entire life.

One of the items that ended up on the cutting-room floor was ethics, which you also suggest people study.\nNaval: I was going to put that out as a concession to people who believe making money is evil and that the only way to make it is to be evil. But then I realized ethics is not necessarily something you study. It\u2019s something you think about\u2014and something you do.\nEthics isn\u2019t something you study; it\u2019s something you do\nEveryone has a personal moral code. Where we get our moral code differs for everybody. It\u2019s not like I can point you to a textbook. I can point you to some Roman or Greek text, but that\u2019s not suddenly going to make you ethical.\nThere\u2019s the Golden Rule: \u201cDo unto others as you would have them do unto you.\u201d Or there\u2019s Nassim Taleb\u2019s Silver Rule, which is, \u201cDon\u2019t do unto others what you don\u2019t want them doing unto you.\u201d\nTrust leads to compounding relationships\nOnce you\u2019ve been in business long enough, you will realize how much of it is about trust. It\u2019s about trust because you want to compound interest. You want to work with trustworthy people for long periods of time without having to reevaluate every discussion or constantly look over your shoulder.\nOver time you will gravitate to working with certain kinds of people. Similarly, those people will gravitate to working with other ethical people.\nBeing ethical attracts other long-term players\nActing ethically turns out to be a selfish imperative. You want to be ethical because it attracts other long-term players in the network. They want to do business with ethical people.\nIf you build a reputation for being ethical, people eventually will pay you just to do deals through you. Your involvement will validate deals and ensure they get done; because you wouldn\u2019t be involved with low-quality stuff.\nIn the long run, being ethical pays off\u2014but it\u2019s the very long run. In the short run, being unethical pays off, which is why so many people go for it. It\u2019s short-term greedy.\nBeing ethical is long-term greedy\nYou can be ethical simply because you\u2019re long-term greedy. I can even outline a framework for different parts of ethics just based on the idea of long-term selfishness.\nFor example, you want to be honest because it leaves you with a clear mind. You don\u2019t want two threads running in your head, one with the lies you tell \u2014and now have to keep track of\u2014and the other with the truth. If you are honest, you only have to think about one thing at a time, which frees up mental energy and makes you a clearer thinker.\nAlso, by being honest you\u2019re rejecting people who only want to hear pretty lies. You force those people out of your network. Sometimes it\u2019s painful, especially with friends and family; but over the long term you create room for the people who like you exactly the way that you are. That is a selfish reason to be honest.\nIf you cut fair deals, you will get paid in the long run\nNegotiations offer another good example. If you\u2019re the kind of person who always tries to get the best deal for yourself, you will win a lot of early deals and it will feel very good.\nOn the other hand, a few people will recognize that you\u2019re always scrabbling and not acting fairly, and they will tend to avoid you. Over time those are the people who end up being the dealmakers in the network. People go to them for a fair shake or to figure out what\u2019s fair.\nIf you cut people fair deals, you won\u2019t get paid in the short term. But over the long term, everybody will want to deal with you. You end up being a market hub. You have more information. You have trust. You have a reputation. And people end up doing deals through you in the long run.\nA lot of wisdom involves realizing long-term consequences of your actions. The longer your time horizon, the wiser you\u2019re going to seem to everybody around you.\nRelated", "sentiment": -0.222, "pageUrl": "https://nav.al/ethics", "date": "Tue, 25 Jun 2019 23:00:00 GMT", "person": "naval_ravikant"}, {"title": "We Should All Be Working for Ourselves", "text": "Nivi: Who is this advice targeted to?

Anybody who wants to control their own life. Anybody who wants to deterministically and reliably improve their ability to create wealth over time, is patient, and is looking at the long haul.\nIf you\u2019re 80 years old, retired and running out of energy, it\u2019s probably best to stay retired. But there are 80-year-olds who have a lot of energy, who want to do new things and live for the future.\nObviously this can apply very easily to a young person. I would say 9 or 10 years old and up.\nMidlife can be the most fruitful time to apply this advice\nThe most difficult one is probably midlife. When we\u2019re in our 30s, 40s and 50s, we already have a lot invested. We have a lot of obligations. Those are the years we\u2019re earning; people are relying on us. We don\u2019t want to change because we don\u2019t want to admit defeat.\nBut that\u2019s when it actually can be the most fruitful. It may be the most difficult pivot: You have a 9-to-5 job; you have a family relying on you.\nIt may seem like the things in this podcast are far too idealistic, but maybe it can inform your weekend projects. Maybe it can inform your approach to education; for example, if you\u2019re taking an online course at night. Maybe it can inform what roles you take on at your current company, because they move you closer and closer to points of leverage, points of judgment or points where you\u2019re naturally talented, and you\u2019re able to be more authentic. It might cause you to take on more accountability.\nEven if applied piecemeal, these principles can guide you\u2014regardless of what stage of life you are in, short of retirement. If you\u2019re retired, test them to see if they\u2019re true and then teach them to your kids or grandkids.\nThere are many different ways to participate. It should apply to almost everybody who has a complete body, sound mind, and is looking to work.\nLook up the value chain to find leverage\nNivi: One way to apply this advice is to look at who is getting leverage off of the work that you\u2019re doing. Look up the value chain\u2014at who\u2019s above you and who\u2019s above them\u2014and see how they are taking advantage of the time and work you\u2019re doing and how they\u2019re applying leverage.\nPeople naturally do this because they want to move up the corporate ladder; but that\u2019s mostly about managing other people. You want to manage more capital, products, media and community.\nPeople think about moving up the ladder in their organization. But they don\u2019t often think about moving to a different organization or creating their own company to get more leverage.\nYou will do better in a small organization\nNaval: In general, ceteris paribus\u2014fancy Latin words for \u201call else being equal\u201d\u2014you \u2019ll do better in a smaller organization than a larger one.\nYou will have more accountability, and your work will be more visible. You\u2019re more likely to be able to try different things, which can help you discover the thing you are uniquely good at. People will be more likely to give you leverage through battlefield promotions. You\u2019ll have more flexibility. There will be more authenticity in how the company operates.\nHere is a good progression for a career: Start in a large company and progressively move to smaller and smaller ones. It\u2019s very hard to go from a small company to a larger company. Larger companies tend to be more about politics than merit; they\u2019re more stable but less innovative.\nThe goal is that we are all working for ourselves\nThe long-term goal is that we are all wealthy and working for ourselves. The people working for us are essentially robots. Today that\u2019s software robots executing code in data centers. Tomorrow it could be delivery bots, flying bots and mechanical bots\u2014and drones\u2014that are carrying things around.\nThis goes back to the idea that the best relationships are peer relationships. If there\u2019s someone above you, that\u2019s someone to learn from. If you\u2019re not learning from them and improving, nobody should be above you.\nIf there\u2019s somebody below you, it\u2019s because you\u2019re teaching them and enabling them. If you\u2019re not doing that, then get a robot; you don\u2019t need a human below you.\nThis is utopian and still a long way off, but in the not-too-distant future anybody who wants to work for themself will be able to do it.\nYou may have to make sacrifices and take on more risk. You may have to take on more accountability and live with less steady income.

My first question: What are some common failures or things people typically do wrong when they try to apply this advice?\nNaval: A lot of people don\u2019t understand what specific knowledge is or how to \u201cobtain\u201d it. People don\u2019t understand what accountability entails. They think accountability means being successfully accountable. No\u2014it means you have to stick your neck out and fail publicly. You have to be willing to let people criticize you.\nOne of the reasons I\u2019m less active on Twitter lately is because every tweet summons an army of nitpickers and haters. It gets exhausting. You have to learn to ignore them, or you won\u2019t survive on Twitter.\nA lot of people try to reconcile this by asking, \u201cShould I quit my 9-to-5 job or not?\u201d That can be a hard decision. You don\u2019t need to go to that extreme. You can start applying accountability, leverage and specific knowledge within your existing career.

If you disagree with it, maybe that\u2019s an area where you can improve your thinking. I improve my thinking all the time.\nIn this tweetstorm I put down the minimum-viable principles. I shared only a small slice of what I\u2019ve learned about how to make money; because 90% of it is suspect.\nI put down the bedrock, the stuff I\u2019m sure about. I have not yet seen a tweet successfully contradicting anything in this tweetstorm that would cause me to say, \u201cI got that one wrong.\u201d\nGet the free leverage that\u2019s available in tech\nSome people will say, \u201cThis only applies to tech entrepreneurs.\u201d I disagree. The real estate example was a good one in that regard.\nTechnology drives leverage\u2014so I\u2019m going to push you in a tech direction to get that free leverage. Obviously, this message is being delivered through the Internet, so it\u2019s going to have a pro-Internet bias.\nDon\u2019t refuse to do things just because others can\u2019t do them\nSome people believe it\u2019s unfair to do anything with the opportunities they have because others don\u2019t have the same opportunities. With a defeatist attitude like that, why even get out of bed in the morning? Ninety percent of people are dead.\nMany people live on a dollar or less a day. Do you? No. You play the hand you\u2019re dealt to the best of your ability.

They view it as a giant zero-sum game. That\u2019s a false narrative, too. Elon Musk is not playing a zero-sum game with the environment; there are plenty of entrepreneurs like him.\nThere is a word environmentalists love: sustainability. If nothing else, for-profit businesses are financially sustainable. You can do a B Corporation, which has a dual mission.\nMany non-profit efforts would be better off as for-profit companies.

We don\u2019t charge for anything. We don\u2019t sell anything. Not because I don\u2019t want to make more money\u2014it\u2019s always nice to make more money; we\u2019re doing work here\u2014but because it would completely destroy the credibility of the enterprise. If I say, \u201cI know how to get rich, and I\u2019m going to sell that to you,\u201d then it ruins it.\nWhen I was young, one of my favorite books on the topic was \u201cHow To Get Rich,\u201d by Felix Dennis, the founder of Maxim Magazine. He had a lot of crazy stuff in there. But he had some really good insights too.\nWhenever I read something by him or by GoDaddy founder Bob Parsons or Andrew Carnegie\u2014people who are already very wealthy, and they clearly made their wealth in other fields, not by selling the how-to-get-rich line\u2014they have a credibility. You just trust them.\nThey\u2019re not trying to make money off of you. They\u2019re obviously trying to win some status and some ego\u2014you always have to have a motivation for doing something. But at least that\u2019s a cleaner reason and why they\u2019re probably not lying. They\u2019re probably not fooling you. They\u2019re not snowing you.\nEvery founder has to lie to every employee\nAt some level every founder has to lie to every employee of the company they have. They have to convince them, \u201cIt\u2019s better for you to work for me than to do what I did and go work for yourself.\u201d\nI\u2019ve always had a hard time with that.\nThe only honest way to do this, in my opinion, is to tell the entrepreneurs I recruit: \u201cYou\u2019re going to be entrepreneurial in this company, and the day you\u2019re ready to start your own next thing, I\u2019m going to support you. I\u2019m never going to get in the way of you starting a company. But this can be a good place for you to learn how to build a good team and build a good culture; how to find product-market fit; how to perfect your skills; and to meet some amazing people while you figure out exactly what it is you\u2019re going to do. Because positioning, timing and deliberation are very important when starting a company.\u201d\nWhat I\u2019ve never been able to do is to look them in the face and say, \u201cYou must be at your desk by 8 a.m.\u201d Because I\u2019m not going to be at my desk by 8 a.m. I want my freedom. I\u2019ve never been able to say to them, \u201cYou\u2019re great at being a director today, and you\u2019ll be a VP tomorrow,\u201d putting them into that cold career path track. Because I don\u2019t believe in it myself.\nAnyone giving advice on how to get rich should have made their money elsewhere\nIf anyone is giving advice on how to get rich and they\u2019re also making money off of it, they should have made their money elsewhere. You don\u2019t want to learn how to be fit from a fat person. You don\u2019t want to learn how to be happy from a depressed person. So, you don\u2019t want to learn how to be rich from a poor person. But you also don\u2019t want to learn how to be rich from somebody who makes their money by telling people how to be rich. It\u2019s suspect.\nNivi: Any time you see somebody who\u2019s gotten rich following some guru\u2019s advice on getting rich, remember that in any random process, if you run it long enough and if enough people participate in it, you will always get every single possible outcome with probability one.\nNaval: There\u2019s a lot of random error in there. This is why you have to absolutely and completely ignore business journalists and economist academics when they talk about private companies.\nI won\u2019t name names, but when a famous economist rails on Bitcoin, or when a business journalist attacks the latest company that\u2019s IPO\u2019ing, it\u2019s complete nonsense. Those people have never built anything. They\u2019re professional critics. They don\u2019t know anything about making money. All they know is how to criticize and get pageviews. And you\u2019re literally becoming dumber by reading them. You\u2019re burning neurons.\nI\u2019ll leave you with a quote from Nassim Taleb that I liked. He said, \u201cTo become a philosopher king, start with being a king, not being a philosopher.\u201d\nNivi: I\u2019m glad you brought up Taleb, because I was going to finish this by saying: remember the title of his first book, \u201cFooled By Randomness.\u201d\nNaval: One of the reasons we\u2019re a little vague in this podcast is because we\u2019re trying to lay down principles that are timeless, as opposed to giving you the winning lottery ticket numbers from yesterday.", "sentiment": 0.372, "pageUrl": "https://nav.al/rich-quick", "date": "Wed, 22 May 2019 23:00:00 GMT", "person": "naval_ravikant"}, {"title": "A Calm Mind, a Fit Body, a House Full of Love", "text": "Nivi: The last tweet on the topic of working for the long-term is: \u201cWhen you\u2019re finally wealthy, you\u2019ll realize it wasn\u2019t what you were seeking in the first place. But that\u2019s for another day.\u201d\nNaval: That\u2019s a multi-hour topic in and of itself. First of all, I thought it was a really clever way to end the whole thing. It disarms a whole set of people who say, \u201cWhat\u2019s the point of getting rich?\u201d There are a lot of people who like to virtue signal against the idea of wealth creation or making money.\nIt\u2019s also true. Yes, money will solve all your money problems. But it doesn\u2019t get you everywhere.\nThe first thing you realize when you\u2019ve made a bunch of money is that you\u2019re still the same person. If you\u2019re happy, you\u2019re happy. If you\u2019re unhappy, you\u2019re unhappy. If you\u2019re calm and fulfilled and peaceful, you\u2019re still that same person. I know lots of very rich people who are extremely out of shape. I know lots of rich people who have really bad family lives. I know lots of rich people who are internally a mess.\nA calm mind, a fit body and a house full of love must be earned\nI would lean on another tweet that I put out. When I think back on it, I think it\u2019s my favorite tweet. It\u2019s not necessarily the most insightful. It\u2019s not necessarily the most helpful. It\u2019s not even the one I think about the most. But when I look at it, there\u2019s such a certain truth in there that it resonates. And that is: \u201cA fit body, a calm mind, a house full of love. These things cannot be bought\u2014they must be earned.\u201d\nEven if you have all the money in the world, you can\u2019t have those three things. Jeff Bezos still has to work out. He still has to work on his marriage. And his internal mental state still very much won\u2019t be controlled by external events. It\u2019s going to be based on how calm and peaceful he is inside.\nSo I think those three things\u2014your health, your mental health and your close relationships\u2014are things you have to cultivate. They can bring you a lot more peace and happiness than any amount of money ever will.\nPractical advice for a calmer internal state\nHow to get there is a tweetstorm I\u2019ve been working on. I have probably 100 tweets on it. It\u2019s very hard to say anything on the topic without getting attacked from 50 different directions, especially these days on Twitter. So I\u2019ve been hesitant to do it. I want to target it for a very specific kind of person.\nThere\u2019s a bunch of people who don\u2019t believe working on your internal state is useful. They\u2019re too focused on the external. And that\u2019s fine, there\u2019s nothing wrong with that. That\u2019s who the \u201cHow to Get Rich\u201d tweetstorm is for. There\u2019s a bunch of people who believe the only thing worth working on is complete liberation. Like, you become the Buddha. They\u2019ll attack anything in the middle as being useless. That\u2019s fine, too. But most people aren\u2019t there.\nI want to create a tweetstorm that offers practical advice for everyday people who want a calmer internal state. A set of understandings, realizations, half-truths and truths, that if you were to imbibe them properly\u2014and, again, these are pointers to ideas you already have and experiences you already have\u2014that if you keep these top of mind, slowly but steadily it will help you with certain realizations that will lead you to a calmer internal state. That\u2019s what I want to work on.\nFitness is another big one, I\u2019m just not the expert there. There are plenty of good people on Twitter that who are better at fitness than me.\nA lot of divorces happen over money, a lot of battles happen over internal anger\nI think a loving household and relationships actually fall naturally out of the other things. If you have a calm mind and you\u2019ve already made money, you should have good relationships. There\u2019s no reason why you shouldn\u2019t. A lot of divorces happen over money. Unfortunately, that\u2019s just the reality of it. Having money removes that part of it.\nA lot of external battles happen because your internal state is not good. When you\u2019re naturally internally peaceful you\u2019re going to pick fewer fights. You\u2019re going to be more loving without expecting anything in return. That will take care of things on the external-relationship front.\nNivi: To summarize: Money solves your money problems. Money buys you freedom in the material world. And money lets you not do the things you don\u2019t want to do.\nNaval: Yeah. To me the ultimate purpose of money is so you don\u2019t have to be in a specific place, at a specific time, doing anything you don\u2019t want to do.", "sentiment": 0.922, "pageUrl": "https://nav.al/finally-wealthy", "date": "Mon, 20 May 2019 23:00:00 GMT", "person": "naval_ravikant"}, {"title": "Eventually You Will Get What You Deserve", "text": "Nivi: We\u2019re talking about working for the long-term. The next tweet on that topic: \u201cApply specific knowledge, with leverage, and eventually you will get what you deserve.\u201d\nI would add: Apply judgment, apply accountability, and apply the skill of reading.\nNaval: This one is a glib way of saying, \u201cIt takes time.\u201d Once you have all of the pieces in place, there\u2019s still an indeterminate amount of time you have to put in. And if you\u2019re counting, you\u2019ll run out of patience before it arrives.\nYou have to make sure you give these things time. Life is long.\nCharlie Munger had a line on this. Somebody asked him about making money. He said what the questioner actually was asking was, \u201cHow can I become like you, except faster?\u201d\nEverybody wants it immediately. But the world is an efficient place. Immediate doesn\u2019t work. You have to put in the time. You have to put in the hours. You have to put yourself in that position with specific knowledge, accountability, leverage and an authentic skill-set in order to be the best in the world at what you do.\nAnd then you have to enjoy it and keep doing it and doing it and doing it. Don\u2019t keep track. Don\u2019t keep count. Because if you do, you will run out of time.\nLooking back on my career, the people who I identified as brilliant and hardworking two decades ago are all successful now, almost without exception. On a long enough timescale, you will get paid.\nBut it can easily be 10 or 20 years. Sometimes it\u2019s five. If it\u2019s five, or three, and it\u2019s a friend of yours who got there, it can drive you insane. But those are exceptions. And for every winner, there are multiple failures.\nOne thing that\u2019s important in entrepreneurship: You just have to be right once. You get many, many shots on goal. You can take a shot on goal every three to five years, maybe every 10 at the slowest. Or once every year at the fastest, depending on how you\u2019re iterating with startups. But you only have to be right once.\nWhat are you really good at, that the market values?\nNivi: Your eventual outcome will be equal to something like the distinctiveness of your specific knowledge; times how much leverage you can apply to that knowledge; times how often your judgment is correct; times how singularly accountable you are for the outcome; times how much society values what you\u2019re doing. Then you compound that with how long you can keep doing it and how long you can keep improving it through reading and learning.\nNaval: That\u2019s a really good way to summarize it. It\u2019s worth trying to sketch that equation out.\nThat said, people try to apply mathematics to what is really philosophy. I\u2019ve seen this happen, where I say one thing and then I say another thing that seems contradictory if you treat it as math. But it\u2019s obviously in a different context.\nPeople will say, \u201cYou say, \u2018Desire is suffering.\u2019\u201d You know, the Buddhist saying. \u201cAnd then you \u2018All greatness comes from suffering.\u2019 So does that mean all greatness comes from desire?\u201d This isn\u2019t math. You can\u2019t just carry variables around and form absolute logical outputs. You have to know when to apply things.\nOne can\u2019t get too analytical about it.\nIt\u2019s what a physicist would call \u201cfalse precision.\u201d When you take two made-up estimates and multiply them together, you get four degrees of precision. Those decimal points don\u2019t actually count. You don\u2019t have that data. You don\u2019t have that knowledge. The more estimated variables you have, the greater the error in the model.\nAdding more complexity to your decision-making process gets you a worse answer. You\u2019re better off picking the single biggest thing or two. Ask yourself: What am I really good at, according to observation and people I trust, that the market values?\nThose two variables alone are probably good enough. If you\u2019re good at it, you\u2019ll keep it up. You\u2019ll develop the judgment. If you\u2019re good at it and you like to do it, eventually people will give you the resources and you won\u2019t be afraid to take on accountability. So the other pieces will fall into place.\nProduct-market fit is inevitable if you\u2019re doing something you love and the market wants it.", "sentiment": -0.295, "pageUrl": "https://nav.al/eventually", "date": "Sat, 18 May 2019 23:00:00 GMT", "person": "naval_ravikant"}, {"title": "Play Stupid Games, Win Stupid Prizes", "text": "Nivi: When you\u2019re being authentic, you don\u2019t mind competition that much. It pisses you off and inspires some fear, jealousy and other emotions. But you don\u2019t really mind because you\u2019re oriented towards the goal and the mission. Worst-case, you might get some ideas from them. And often there are ways to work with the competition in a positive way that ends up increasing the size of the market for you.\nNaval: It depends on the nature of the business. The best Silicon Valley tech industry businesses tend to be winner-take-all. When you see competition, it can make you fly into a rage. Because it really does endanger everything you\u2019ve built.\nIf I\u2019m opening a restaurant and a more interesting version of the same restaurant opens in a different town, that\u2019s fantastic. I\u2019m going to copy what\u2019s working and drop what\u2019s not working. So it depends on the nature of the business.\nOften, businesses that seem to be in direct competition really aren\u2019t. They end up adjacent or slightly different. You\u2019re one step away from a completely different business, and sometimes you need to take that step. You\u2019re not going to take it if you\u2019re busy fighting over a booby prize.\nYou\u2019re playing a stupid game. You\u2019re going to win a stupid prize. It\u2019s not obvious right now because you\u2019re blinded by competition. But three years from now, it\u2019ll be obvious.\nMy first company got caught in the wrong game\nOne of my first startups was Epinions, an online product review site that was independent of Amazon. That space eventually turned into TripAdvisor and Yelp, which is where we should have gone.\nWe should have done more local reviews. A review of a scarce item like a local restaurant is more valuable than one of an item like a camera that has 1,000 reviews on Amazon.\nBefore we could get there, we got caught up in the comparison-shopping game. We merged with DealTime and competed with a bunch of price-comparison engines\u2014mySimon, PriceGrabber, NexTag and Bizrate, which became Shopzilla. We were caught in fierce competition with each other.\nThat whole space went to zero because Amazon won e-tail completely. There was no need for price comparison. Everyone just went to Amazon.\nWe got the booby prize because we were caught up in competition with a bunch of our peers. We should have been looking at what the consumer really wanted and being authentic to ourselves, which was reviews, not price comparison. We should have gone further into esoteric items where customers had less data and wanted reviews more badly.\nIf we stayed authentic to ourselves, we would have done better.", "sentiment": 0.263, "pageUrl": "https://nav.al/stupid-games", "date": "Thu, 16 May 2019 23:00:00 GMT", "person": "naval_ravikant"}, {"title": "Escape Competition Through Authenticity", "text": "Nivi: Let\u2019s discuss your tweet: \u201cEscape competition through authenticity.\u201d It sounds like part of this is a search for who you are.\nNaval: It\u2019s both a search and a recognition. Sometimes when we search our egos, we want to be something that we\u2019re not. Our friends and family are actually better at telling us who we are. Looking back at what we\u2019ve done is a better indicator of who we are.\nPeter Thiel talks a lot about how competition is besides the point. It\u2019s counterproductive. We\u2019re highly memetic creatures. We copy everybody around us. We copy our desires from them.\nIf everyone around me is a great artist, I want to be an artist. If everyone around me is a great businessperson, I want to be a businessperson. If everybody around me is a social activist, I want to be a social activist. That\u2019s where my self-esteem will come from.\nYou have to be careful when you get caught up in status games. You end up competing over things that aren\u2019t worth competing over.\nPeter Thiel talks about how he was going to be a law clerk because everybody at law school wanted to clerk for a Supreme Court justice or some famous judge. He got rejected, and that\u2019s what made him go into business. It helped him break out of a lesser game and into a greater game.\nSometimes you get trapped in the wrong game because you\u2019re competing. The best way to escape competition\u2014to get away from the specter of competition, which is not just stressful and nerve-wracking but also will drive you to the wrong answer\u2014is to be authentic to yourself.\nNo one can compete with you on being you\nIf you are building and marketing something that\u2019s an extension of who you are, no one can compete with you. Who\u2019s going to compete with Joe Rogan or Scott Adams? It\u2019s impossible. Is somebody else going write a better Dilbert? No. Is someone going to compete with Bill Watterson and create a better Calvin and Hobbes? No.\nArtist are, by definition, authentic. Entrepreneurs are authentic, too. Who\u2019s going to be Elon Musk? Who\u2019s going to be Jack Dorsey? These people are authentic, and the businesses and products they create are authentic to their desires and means.\nIf somebody else came along and started launching rockets, I don\u2019t think it would faze Elon one bit. He\u2019s still going to get to Mars. Because that\u2019s his mission, insane as it seems. He\u2019s going to accomplish it.\nAuthenticity naturally gets you away from competition. Does it mean that you want to be authentic to the point where there\u2019s no product-market fit? It may turn out that you\u2019re the best juggler on a unicycle. But maybe there isn\u2019t much of a market for that, even with YouTube videos. So you have to adjust until you find product-market fit.\nAt least lean towards authenticity, towards getting away from competition. Competition leads to copy-catting and playing the completely wrong game.\nIn entrepreneurship, the masses are never right\nIn entrepreneurship, the masses are never right. If the masses knew how to build great things and create great wealth, we\u2019d all be rich by now.\nWhen you see a lot of competition, sometimes that indicates the masses have already arrived. It\u2019s already competed over too much. Or it\u2019s the wrong trend to begin with.\nOn the other hand, if the whole market is empty, that can be a warning indicator. It can indicate you\u2019ve gone too authentic and should focus more on the product-market part of founder-product-market fit.\nThere\u2019s a balance you have to find. Generally, people will make the mistake of paying too much attention to the competition. The great founders tend to be authentic iconoclasts.\nCombine your vocation and avocation\nNivi: Do you think one way of getting to authenticity is by finding five or six various skills you already do and stacking them on top of each other, maybe not even in any purposeful way? If you are expressing who you are, you\u2019re going to be expressing all of these skills anyway.\nNaval: If you are successful, in the long-term you\u2019ll find you\u2019re almost doing all of your hobbies for a living, no matter what they are. As Robert Frost said, \u201cmy goal in life is to unite my avocation with my vocation.\u201d That\u2019s really where life is going to lead you anyway.\nYou\u2019re right about the skill stack. Everyone has multiple skills. We aren\u2019t one-dimensional creatures, even though that\u2019s how we portray ourselves in online profiles to get employed. You meet somebody and they say, \u201cI\u2019m a banker.\u201d Or, \u201cI\u2019m a bartender. Or \u201cI\u2019m a barber.\u201d\nSpecialize in being you\nBut people are multivariate. They have a lot of skills. One banker might be good at finance. Another one might be good at sales. A third one might be good at macroeconomic trends and have a feel for markets. Another one might be really good at picking individual stocks. Another might be good at maintaining relationships, rather than selling new relationships. Everyone\u2019s going to have various niches. And you\u2019re going to have multiple niches. It\u2019s not going to be just one.\nAs you go through your career, you\u2019ll find you gravitate towards the things you\u2019re good at, which by definition are the things you enjoy doing. Otherwise, you wouldn\u2019t be good at them. You wouldn\u2019t have put in the time.\nOther people will push you towards the things you\u2019re good at, too. Because your smart bosses, co-workers and investors will realize you\u2019re world-class in this one thing. And you can recruit people to help you with other things.\nIdeally, you want to end up specializing in being you.\nRelated", "sentiment": 0, "pageUrl": "https://nav.al/competition-authenticity", "date": "Wed, 15 May 2019 23:00:00 GMT", "person": "naval_ravikant"}, {"title": "Keep Redefining What You Do", "text": "Nivi: We talked about the importance of working hard and valuing your time.

I have almost no meetings on it. When some people see my calendar, they almost weep.\nSecond, I\u2019m busy all the time. I\u2019m always doing something. It\u2019s usually work-related. It\u2019s whatever high-impact thing that needs to be done, that I\u2019m most inspired to do.\nThe only way to do that is to constantly, and ruthlessly, decline meetings.\nPeople want to \u201cdo coffee\u201d and build relationships.

But later in your career\u2014when you\u2019re exploiting, and there are more things coming at you than you have time for\u2014you have to ruthlessly cut meetings out of your life.\nRuthlessly cut meetings\nIf someone wants a meeting, see if they will do a call instead. If they want to call, see if they will email instead. If they want to email, see if they will text instead.

Do standing meetings. Keep them short, actionable and small. Nothing is getting done in a meeting with eight people around a conference table. You are literally dying one hour at a time.\nNivi: \u201cDoing coffee\u201d reminds me of an old quote, I think from Steve Jobs, when someone asked him why Apple didn\u2019t come to a convention. His response was something like, \u201cBecause we wouldn\u2019t be here working.\u201d\nNaval: I used to have a tough time turning people down for meetings. Now I just tell them outright, \u201cI don\u2019t do non-transactional meetings. I don\u2019t do meetings without a strict agenda. I don\u2019t do meetings unless we absolutely have to.\u201d\nNivi used to do this. When people asked us for get-to-know-you meetings, he would say, \u201cWe don\u2019t do meetings unless it\u2019s life-and-death urgent.\u201d The person has to respond, \u201cYeah, it\u2019s life-and-death urgent\u201d or there\u2019s no meeting.\nPeople will meet with you when you have proof of work\nBusy people will take your meeting when you have something important or valuable. But you have to come with a proper calling card. It should be: \u201cHere\u2019s what I\u2019ve done. Here\u2019s what I can show you. Let\u2019s meet if this is useful to you, and I\u2019ll be respectful of your time.\u201d\nYou have to build up credibility. For example, when a tech investor looks at a startup, the first thing they want to see is evidence of product progress. They don\u2019t just want to see a slide deck. Product progress is the entrepreneur\u2019s resume. It\u2019s an unfake-able resume.\nYou have to do the work. To use a crypto analogy, you have to have proof of work. If you have that and you truly have something interesting, then you shouldn\u2019t hesitate to put it together in an email and send it. Even then, when asking for a meeting, you want to be actionable.\nFree your time and mind\nIf you think you\u2019re going to \u201cmake it\u201d by networking and attending a bunch of meetings, you\u2019re probably wrong. Networking can be important early in your career. And you can get serendipitous with meetings. But the odds are pretty low.\nWhen you meet people hoping for that lucky break, you\u2019re relying on Type One luck, which is blind luck, and Type Two luck, which is hustle luck.\nBut you\u2019re not getting Type Three or Type Four luck, which are the better kinds. This is where you spend time developing a reputation and working on something. You develop a unique point of view and are able to spot opportunities that others can\u2019t.\nA busy calendar and a busy mind will destroy your ability to do great things in this world. If you want to do great things\u2014whether you\u2019re a musician or entrepreneur or investor\u2014you need free time and a free mind.", "sentiment": -0.672, "pageUrl": "https://nav.al/meetings", "date": "Tue, 07 May 2019 23:00:00 GMT", "person": "naval_ravikant"}, {"title": "Work As Hard As You Can", "text": "Naval: Let\u2019s talk about hard work. There\u2019s a battle that happens on Twitter a lot. Should you work hard or should you not? David Heinemeier Hansson says, \u201cIt\u2019s like you\u2019re slave-driving people.\u201d Keith Rabois says, \u201cNo, all the great founders worked their fingers to the bone.\u201d\nThey\u2019re talking past each other.\nFirst of all, they\u2019re talking about two different things. David is talking about employees and a lifestyle business. If you\u2019re doing that, your number one priority is not getting wealthy. You have a job, a family and also your life.\nKeith is talking about the Olympics of startups. He\u2019s talking about the person going for the gold medal and trying to build a multi-billion dollar public company. That person has to get everything right. They have to have great judgment. They have to pick the right thing to work on. They have to recruit the right team. They have to work crazy hard. They\u2019re engaged in a competitive sprint.\nIf getting wealthy is your goal, you\u2019re going to have to work as hard as you can. But hard work is no substitute for who you work with and what you work on. Those are the most important things.\nWhat you work on and who you work with are more important\nMarc Andreessen came up with the concept of the \u201cproduct-market fit.\u201d I would expand that to \u201cproduct-market-founder fit,\u201d taking into account how well a founder is personally suited to the business. The combination of the three should be your overwhelming goal.\nYou can save a lot of time by picking the right area to work in. Picking the right people to work with is the next most important piece. Third comes how hard you work. They are like three legs of a stool. If you shortchange any one of them, the whole stool is going to fall. You can\u2019t easily pick one over the other.\nWhen you\u2019re building a business, or a career, first figure out: \u201cWhat should I be doing? Where is a market emerging? What\u2019s a product I can build that I\u2019m excited to work on, where I have specific knowledge?\u201d\nNo matter how high your bar is, raise it\nSecond, surround yourself with the best people possible. If there\u2019s someone greater out there to work with, go work with them. When people ask for advice about choosing the right startup to join, I say, \u201cPick the one that\u2019s going to have the best alumni network for you in the future.\u201d Look at the PayPal mafia\u2014they worked with a bunch of geniuses, so they all got rich. Pick the people with the highest intelligence, energy and integrity that you can find.\nAnd no matter how high your bar is, raise it.\nFinally, once you\u2019ve picked the right thing to work on and the right people, work as hard as you can.\nNobody really works 80 hours a week\nThis is where the mythology gets a little crazy. People who say they work 80-hour weeks, or even 120-hour weeks, often are just status signaling. It\u2019s showing off. Nobody really works 80 to 120 hours a week at high output, with mental clarity. Your brain breaks down. You won\u2019t have good ideas.\nThe way people tend to work most effectively, especially in knowledge work, is to sprint as hard as they can while they feel inspired to work, and then rest. They take long breaks.\nIt\u2019s more like a lion hunting and less like a marathoner running. You sprint and then you rest. You reassess and then you try again. You end up building a marathon of sprints.\nInspiration is perishable\nInspiration is perishable. When you have inspiration, act on it right then and there.\nIf I\u2019m inspired to write a blog post or publish a tweetstorm, I should do it right away. Otherwise, it\u2019s not going to get out there. I won\u2019t come back to it. Inspiration is a beautiful and powerful thing. When you have it, seize it.\nImpatience with actions, patience with results\nPeople talk about impatience. When do you know to be impatient? When do you know to be patient? My glib tweet on this was: \u201cImpatience with actions, patience with results.\u201d I think that\u2019s a good philosophy for life.\nAnything you have to do, get it done. Why wait? You\u2019re not getting any younger.\nYou don\u2019t want to spend your life waiting in line. You don\u2019t want to spend it traveling back and forth. You don\u2019t want to spend it doing things that aren\u2019t part of your mission.\nWhen you do these things, do them as quickly as you can and with your full attention so you do them well. Then be patient with the results because you\u2019re dealing with complex systems and a lot of people.\nIt takes a long time for markets to adopt products. It takes time for people to get comfortable working with each other. It takes time for great products to emerge as you polish away.\nImpatience with actions, patience with results.\nIf I discover a problem in one of my businesses, I won\u2019t sleep until the resolution is at least in motion. If I\u2019m on the board of a company, I\u2019ll call the CEO. If I\u2019m running the company, I\u2019ll call my reports. If I\u2019m responsible, I\u2019ll get on it, right then and there, and solve it.\nIf I don\u2019t solve a problem the moment it happens\u2014or if I don\u2019t move towards solving it\u2014I have no peace. I have no rest. I have no happiness until the problem is solved. So I solve it as quickly as possible. I literally won\u2019t sleep until it\u2019s solved\u2014maybe that\u2019s just a personal characteristic. But it\u2019s worked out well in business.", "sentiment": 0.74, "pageUrl": "https://nav.al/work-hard", "date": "Sun, 05 May 2019 23:00:00 GMT", "person": "naval_ravikant"}, {"title": "Example: From Laborer to Entrepreneur", "text": "Naval: The tweetstorm is very abstract. It\u2019s deliberately meant to be broadly applicable to all kinds of different domains and disciplines and time periods and places. But sometimes it\u2019s hard to work without a concrete example. So let\u2019s go concrete for a minute.\nLook at the real estate business. You could start at the bottom, let\u2019s say you\u2019re a day laborer. You come in, you fix people\u2019s houses. Someone orders you around, tells you, \u201cBreak that piece of rock. Sand that piece of wood. Put that thing over there.\u201d\nThere\u2019s just all these menial jobs that go on, on a construction site. If you\u2019re working one of those jobs, unless you\u2019re a skilled trade, say, a carpenter or electrician, you don\u2019t really have specific knowledge.\nEven a carpenter or an electrician is not that specific because other people can be trained how to do it. You can be replaced. You get paid your $15, $20, $25, $50, if you\u2019re really lucky, $75 an hour, but that\u2019s about it.\nYou don\u2019t have any leverage other than from the tools that you\u2019re using. If you\u2019re driving a bulldozer that\u2019s better than doing it with your hands. A day laborer in India makes a lot less because they have no tool leverage.\nYou don\u2019t have much accountability. You\u2019re a faceless cog in a construction crew and the owner of the house or the buyer of the house doesn\u2019t know or care that you worked on it.\nGeneral contractors get equity, but they\u2019re also taking risk\nOne step up from that, you might have a contractor, like a general contractor who someone hires to come and fix and repair and build up their house. That general contractor is taking accountability; they\u2019re taking responsibility.\nNow let\u2019s say they got paid $250,000 for the job. Sorry, I\u2019m using Bay Area prices, so maybe I\u2019ll go rest of the world prices, $100,000 for the job to fix up a house, and it actually costs the general contractor, all said and done, $70,000. That contractor\u2019s going to pocket that remaining $30,000.\nThey got the upside. They got the equity but they\u2019re also taking accountability and risk. If the project runs over and there\u2019s losses, then they eat the losses. But you see, just the accountability gives them some form of additional potential income.\nThen, they also have labor leverage because they have a bunch of people working for them. But it probably tops out right there.\nProperty developers pocket the profit by applying capital leverage\nYou can go one level above that and you can look at a property developer. This might be someone who is a contractor who did a bunch of houses, did a really good job, then decided to go into business for themselves and they go around looking for beaten down properties that have potential.\nThey buy them, they either raise money from investors or front it themselves, they fix the place up, and then they sell it for twice what they bought it for. Maybe they only put in 20% more, so it\u2019s a healthy profit.\nSo now a developer like that takes on more accountability, has more risk. They have more specific knowledge because now you have to know: which neighborhoods are worth buying in. Which lots are actually good or which lots are bad. What makes or breaks a specific property. You have to imagine the finished house that\u2019s going to be there, even when the property itself might look really bad right now.\nThere\u2019s more specific knowledge, there\u2019s more accountability and risk, and now you also have capital leverage because you\u2019re also putting in money into the project. But conceivably, you could buy a piece of land or a broken-down house for $200,000 and turn it into a million dollar mansion and pocket all the difference.\nArchitects, large developers and REITs are even higher in the stack\nOne level beyond that might be a famous architect or a developer, where just having your name on a property, because you\u2019ve done so many great properties, increases its value.\nOne level up from that, you might be a person who decides, well, I understand real estate, and I now know enough of the dynamics of real estate that rather than just build and flip my own properties or improve my own properties, I\u2019m gonna be a massive developer. I\u2019m going to build entire communities.\nNow another person might say, \u201cI like that leverage, but I don\u2019t want to manage all these people. I want to do it more through capital. So I\u2019m gonna start a real estate investment trust.\u201d That requires specific knowledge not just about investing in real estate and building real estate, but it also requires specific knowledge about the financial markets, and the capital markets, and how real estate trusts operate.\nReal estate tech companies apply the maximum leverage\nOne level beyond that might be somebody who says, \u201cActually, I want to bring the maximum leverage to bear in this market, and the maximum specific knowledge.\u201d That person would say, \u201cWell, I understand real estate, and I understand everything from basic housing construction, to building properties and selling them, to how real estate markets move and thrive, and I also understand the technology business. I understand how to recruit developers, how to write code and how to build good product, and I understand how to raise money from venture capitalists and how to return it and how all of that works.\u201d\nObviously not a single person may know this. You may pull a team together to do it where each have different skill sets, but that combined entity would have specific knowledge in technology and in real estate.\nIt would have massive accountability because that company\u2019s name would be a very high risk, high reward effort attached to the whole thing, and people would devote their lives to it and take on significant risk.\nIt would have leverage in code with lots of developers. It would have capital with investors putting money in and the founder\u2019s own capital. It would have labor of some of the highest quality labor that you can find, which is high quality engineers and designers and marketers who are working on the company.\nThen you may end up with a Trulia or a RedFin or a Zillow kind of company, and then the upside could potentially be in the billions of dollars, or the hundreds of millions of dollars.\nAs you layer in more and more kinds of knowledge that can only be gained on the job and aren\u2019t common knowledge, and you layer in more and more accountability and risk-taking, and you layer in more and more great people working on it and more and more capital on it, and more and more code and media on it, you keep expanding the scope of the opportunity all the way from the day-laborer, who might just literally be scrappling on the ground with their hands, all the way up to somebody who started a real estate tech company and then took it public.", "sentiment": -0.72, "pageUrl": "https://nav.al/laborer-tech", "date": "Thu, 25 Apr 2019 23:00:00 GMT", "person": "naval_ravikant"}, {"title": "Embrace Accountability to Get Leverage", "text": "Nivi: Why don\u2019t we jump into accountability, which I thought was pretty interesting and I think you have your own unique take on it. So the first tweet on accountability was, \u201cEmbrace accountability and take business risks under your own name. Society will reward you with responsibility, equity, and leverage.\u201d\nNaval: Yeah. So to get rich, you\u2019re going to need leverage. Leverage comes in labor, comes in capital, or it can come through code or media. But most of these, like labor and capital, people have to give to you. For labor, somebody has to follow you. For capital, somebody has to give you money or assets to manage or machines.\nSo to get these things, you have to build up credibility and you have to do those under your own name as much as possible, which is risky. So accountability is a double-edged thing. It allows you to take credit when things go well and to bear the brunt of the failure when things go badly.\nTake business risks under your own name\nSo in that sense, people who are stamping their names on things aren\u2019t foolish. They\u2019re just confident. Maybe it turns out to be foolish in the end, but if you look at a Kanye or an Oprah or a Trump or an Elon or anyone like that, these people can get rich just off their name because their name is such powerful branding.\nRegardless of what you think of Trump, you have to realize that the guy was among the best in the world at just branding his name. Why would you go to Trump Casino? Used to be because Trump. Why would you go to a Trump tower? Because of Trump.\nWhen it came time to vote, I think that a lot of voters just went in and said, \u201cTrump.\u201d They recognize the name, so the name recognition paid off.\nSame thing with Oprah. She puts her brand on something, her name on something and it flies off the shelves, and it\u2019s like an instant validator.\nThese people also take risks for putting their name out there. Obviously Trump is now probably hated by half or more than half of the country and by a big chunk of the world as he sticks his name out there.\nBy putting your name out there, you become a celebrity, and fame has many, many downsides. It\u2019s better to be anonymous and rich than to be poor and famous, but even famous and rich has a lot of downsides associated with it. You\u2019re always in the public eye.\nA well-functioning team has clear accountability for each position\nAccountability is quite important, and when you\u2019re working to build a product or you\u2019re working in a team or you\u2019re working in a business, we constantly have drummed into our heads how important it is to be part of a team. Absolutely agree with that.\nA lot of our training socially is telling us to not stick our necks out of the crowd. There\u2019s a saying that I hear from our Australian friends that the tall poppy gets cut. Don\u2019t stick your neck out, but I would say that actually a really, really well-functioning team is small and has clear accountability for each of the different portions.\nYou can say, \u201cOkay, this person\u2019s responsible for building the product. This person\u2019s responsible for the messaging. This person\u2019s responsible for raising money. This person\u2019s responsible for the pricing strategy and maybe the online advertising.\u201d So if somebody screws up, you know exactly who\u2019s responsible. While at the same time if something goes really well, you also know exactly who\u2019s responsible.\nIf you have a small team and you have clearly delineated responsibilities, then you can still keep a very high level of accountability. Accountability is really important because when something succeeds or fails, if it fails, everybody points fingers at each other, and if it succeeds, everybody steps forward to take credit.\nWe\u2019ve all had that experience when we were in school and we got a group assignment to do. There were probably a few people in there who did a lot of the work. Then there are a few people who just did a lot of grandstanding or positioning to do the work. We\u2019re all familiar with this from a childhood sense, but it\u2019s sort of uncomfortable to talk about.\nPeople who can fail in public have a lot of power\nClear accountability is important. Without accountability, you don\u2019t have incentives. Without accountability, you can\u2019t build credibility. But you take risk. You take risk of failure. You take risk of humiliation. You take risk of failure under your own name.\nLuckily in modern society, there\u2019s no more debtors\u2019 prison and people don\u2019t go to jail or get executed for losing other people\u2019s money, but we\u2019re still socially hard wired to not fail in public under our own names. The people who have the ability to fail in public under their own names actually gain a lot of power .\nFor example, I\u2019ll give a personal anecdote. Up until about 2013, 2014, my public persona was an entirely around startups and investing. Only around 2014, 2015 did I start talking about philosophy and psychological things and broader things.\nIt made me a little nervous because I was doing it under my own name. There were definitely people in the industry who sent me messages through the back channel like, \u201cWhat are you doing? You\u2019re ending your career. This is stupid.\u201d\nI kind of just went with it. I took a risk. Same with crypto. Early on, I took a risk.\nBut when you put your name out there, you take a risk with certain things. You also get to reap the rewards. You get the benefits.", "sentiment": 0, "pageUrl": "https://nav.al/accountability-leverage", "date": "Wed, 10 Apr 2019 23:00:00 GMT", "person": "naval_ravikant"}, {"title": "There\u2019s No Actual Skill Called \u201cBusiness\u201d", "text": "Naval: In that sense, business to me is bottom of the barrel. There\u2019s no actual skill called business, it\u2019s too generic. It\u2019s like a skill called \u201crelating.\u201d Like \u201crelating to humans.\u201d That\u2019s not a skill, it\u2019s too broad.\nA lot of what goes on in business schools, and there is some very intelligent stuff taught in business schools \u2013 I don\u2019t mean to detract from them completely \u2013 some of the things taught in business school are just anecdotes. They call them \u201ccase studies.\u201d\nBut they\u2019re just anecdotes, and they\u2019re trying to help you pattern match by throwing lots of data points at you, but the reality is, you will never understand them fully until you\u2019re actually in that position yourself.\nEven then you will find that basic concepts from game theory, psychology, ethics, mathematics, computers, and logic will serve you much, much better.\nI would focus on the foundations, I would focus with a science bent. I would develop a love for reading, including by reading so-called junk food that you\u2019re not supposed to read. You don\u2019t have to read the classics. That [reading] is the foundation for your self-education.\nDoing is faster than watching\nNivi: What did you mean when you said that \u201cdoing is faster than watching?\u201d\nNaval: When it comes to your learning curve, if you want to optimize your learning curve\u2026 One of the reasons why I don\u2019t love podcasts, even though I\u2019m a generator of podcasts, is that I like to consume my information very quickly.\nAnd I\u2019m a good reader, or a fast reader and I can read very fast but I can only listen at a certain speed. I know people listen at 2x, 3x, but everyone sounds like a chipmunk and it\u2019s hard to go back, it\u2019s hard to highlight, it\u2019s hard to pinpoint snippets and save them in your notebook, and so on.\nSimilarly, a lot of people think they can become really skilled at something by watching others do it, or even by reading about others doing it. And going back to the business school case study, that\u2019s a classic example.\nThey study other people\u2019s businesses, but in reality, you\u2019re going to learn a lot more about running a business by operating your own lemonade stand or equivalent. Or even opening a little retail store down the street.\nThat is how you\u2019re going to learn on the job because a lot of the subtleties don\u2019t express themselves until you\u2019re actually in the business.\nFor example, everyone\u2019s into mental models these days. You go to Farnam Street, you go to Poor Charlie\u2019s Almanack, and you can learn all the different mental models. But which ones matter more? Which ones do you apply more often? Which ones matter in which circumstances? That\u2019s actually the hard part.\nFor example, my personal learning has been that the principal-agent problem drives so much in this world. It\u2019s an incentives problem. I\u2019ve learned that tit-for-tat iterated prisoner\u2019s dilemma is the piece of game theory that is worth knowing the most. You can almost put down the game theory book after that.\nBy the way, the best way to learn game theory is to play lots of games. I never even read game theory books. I consider myself extremely good at game theory. I\u2019ve never opened up a game theory book and found a result in there where I didn\u2019t think, \u201cOh, yeah, that\u2019s common sense to me.\u201d\nThe reason is that I grew up playing all kinds of games and I ran into all kinds of corner cases with all kinds of friends, and so it\u2019s just second nature to me. You can always learn better by doing it on the job.\nThe number of \u201cdoing\u201d iterations drives the learning curve\nBut doing is a subtle thing. Doing encapsulates a lot. For example, let\u2019s say, I want to learn how to run a business. Well, if I start a business where I go in every day and I\u2019m doing the same thing, let\u2019s say I\u2019m running a retail store down the street where I\u2019m stocking the shelves with food and liquor every single day, I\u2019m not going to learn that much because I\u2019m repeating things a lot.\nSo, I\u2019m putting in thousands of hours, but they are thousands of hours doing the same thing. Whereas if I was putting in thousands of iterations, that would be different. So, the learning curve is across iterations [not iterations].\nSo if I was trying new marketing experiments in the store all the time, I was constantly changing up the inventory, I was constantly changing up the branding and the messaging, I was constantly changing the sign, I was constantly changing the online channels that are used to drive foot traffic in, I was experimenting with being open at different hours, I had the ability to walk around and talk to other store owners and getting their books and figure out how they run their businesses.\nIt\u2019s the number of iterations that drives the learning curve. So, the more iterations you can have, the more shots on goal you can have, the faster you\u2019re going to learn. It\u2019s not just about the hours put in.\nIf you\u2019re willing to bleed a little every day, you may win big later\nIt\u2019s actually a combination of the two, but I think just the way we\u2019re built and the way that the world presents itself, the world offers us very easily the opportunity to do the same thing over and over and over again. But really, we\u2019d be better served if we went off and found ways to do new things from scratch.\nAnd doing something new the first time is painful, because you\u2019re wandering into uncertain territory and high odds are that you will fail. So you just have to get very, very comfortable with frequent small failures.\nNassim Taleb talks about this also. He made his fortune, his wealth by being a trader who basically relied upon black swans. Nassim Taleb made money by losing little bits of money every day and then once in a blue moon he would make a lot of money when the unthinkable happened for other people.\nWhereas most people want to make little bits of money every day and in exchange they\u2019ll tolerate lots of blow-up risk, they\u2019ll tolerate going completely bankrupt.\nWe\u2019re not evolved to bleed a little bit every day. If you\u2019re out in the natural environment, and you get a cut and you\u2019re literally bleeding a little bit every day, you will eventually die. You\u2019ll have to stop that cut.\nWe\u2019re evolved for small victories all the time but that becomes very expensive. That\u2019s where the crowd is. That\u2019s where the herd is. So, if you\u2019re willing to bleed a little bit every day but in exchange you\u2019ll win big later, you will do better.\nThat is, by the way, entrepreneurship. Entrepreneurs bleed every day.\nThey\u2019re not making money, they\u2019re losing money, they\u2019re constantly stressed out, all the responsibility is upon them, but when they win they win big. On average they\u2019ll make more.", "sentiment": -0.253, "pageUrl": "https://nav.al/skill-business", "date": "Sun, 07 Apr 2019 23:00:00 GMT", "person": "naval_ravikant"}, {"title": "Read What You Love Until You Love to Read", "text": "Nivi: Before we go and talk about accountability and leverage and judgment, you\u2019ve got a few tweets further down the line that I would put in the category of continuous learning.\nThey\u2019re essentially, \u201cthere is no skill called business. Avoid business magazines and business class, study microeconomics, game theory, psychology, persuasion, ethics, mathematics and computers.\u201d\nThere\u2019s one other comment that you made in a Periscope that was, \u201cyou should be able to pick up any book in the library and read it.\u201d And the last tweet in this category was, \u201creading is faster than listening, doing is faster than watching.\u201d\nNaval: Yeah, the most important tweet on this, I don\u2019t even have in here unfortunately, which is, the foundation of learning is reading. I don\u2019t know a smart person who doesn\u2019t read and read all the time.\nAnd the problem is, what do I read? How do I read? Because for most people it\u2019s a struggle, it\u2019s a chore. So, the most important thing is just to learn how to educate yourself and the way to educate yourself is to develop a love for reading.\nSo, the tweet that is left out, the one that I was hinting at is, \u201cread what you love until you love to read.\u201d It\u2019s that simple.\nEverybody I know who reads a lot loves to read, and they love to read because they read books that they loved. It\u2019s a little bit of a catch-22, but you basically want to start off just reading wherever you are and then keep building up from there until reading becomes a habit. And then eventually, you will just get bored of the simple stuff.\nSo you may start off reading fiction, then you might graduate to science fiction, then you may graduate to non-fiction, then you may graduate to science, or philosophy, or mathematics or whatever it is, but take your natural path and just read the things that interest you until you kind of understand them. And then you\u2019ll naturally move to the next thing and the next thing and the next thing.\nRead the original scientific books in a field\nNow, there is an exception to this, which is where I was hinting with what things you actually do want to learn, which is, at some point there\u2019s too much out there to read. Even reading is full of junk.\nThere are actually things you can read, especially early on, that will program your brain a certain way, and then later things that you read, you will decide whether those things are true or false based on the earlier things.\nSo, it is important that you read foundational things. And foundational things, I would say, are the original books in a given field that are very scientific in their nature.\nFor example, instead of reading a business book, pick up Adam Smith\u2019s The Wealth of Nations. Instead of reading a book on biology or evolution that\u2019s written today, I would pick up Darwin\u2019s Origin of the Species. Instead of reading a book on biotech right now that may be very advanced, I would just pick up The Eighth Day of Creation by Watson and Crick. Instead of reading advanced books on what cosmology and what Neil Degrasse Tyson and Stephen Hawking have been saying, you can pick up Richard Feynman\u2019s Six Easy Pieces and start with basic physics.\nDon\u2019t fear any book\nIf you understand the basics, especially in mathematics and physics and sciences, then you will not be afraid of any book. All of us have that memory of when we were sitting in class and we\u2019re learning mathematics, and it was all logical and all made sense until at one point the class moved too fast and we fell behind.\nThen after that we were left memorizing equations, memorizing concepts without being able to derive them from first principles. And at that moment, we\u2019re lost, because unless you\u2019re a professional mathematician, you\u2019re not going to remember those things. All you\u2019re going to remember are the techniques, the foundations.\nSo, you have to make sure that you\u2019re building on a steel frame of understanding because you\u2019re putting together a foundation for skyscraper, and you\u2019re not just memorizing things because you\u2019re just memorizing things you\u2019re lost. So the foundations are ultra important.\nAnd the ultimate, the ultimate is when you walk into a library and you look at it up and down and you don\u2019t fear any book. You know that you can take any book off the shelf, you can read it, you can understand it, you can absorb what is true, you can reject what is false, and you have a basis for even working that out that is logical and scientific and not purely just based on opinions.\nThe means of learning are abundant, the desire to learn is scarce\nThe beauty of the internet is the entire library of Alexandria times 10 is at your fingertips at all times. It\u2019s not the means of education or the means of learning are scarce, the means of learning are abundant. It\u2019s the desire to learn that\u2019s scarce. So, you really have to cultivate the desire.\nAnd it\u2019s not even cultivating you\u2019ve to not lose it. Children have a natural curiosity. If you go to a young child who\u2019s first learning language, they\u2019re pretty much always asking: What\u2019s this? What\u2019s that? Why is this? Who\u2019s that? They\u2019re always asking questions.\nBut one of the problems is that schools and our educational system, and even our way of raising children replaces curiosity with compliance. And once you replace the curiosity with the compliance, you get an obedient factory worker, but you no longer get a creative thinker. And you need creativity, you need the ability to feed your own brain to learn whatever you want.", "sentiment": 0.187, "pageUrl": "https://nav.al/love-read", "date": "Tue, 02 Apr 2019 23:00:00 GMT", "person": "naval_ravikant"}, {"title": "Learn to Sell, Learn to Build", "text": "Nivi: Talking about combining skills, you said that you should \u201clearn to sell, learn to build, if you can do both, you will be unstoppable.\u201d\nNaval: This is a very broad category. It\u2019s two broad categories. One is building the product. Which is hard, and it\u2019s multivariate. It can include design, it can include development, it can include manufacturing, logistics, procurement, it can even be designing and operating a service. It has many, many definitions.\nBut in every industry, there is a definition of the builder. In our tech industry it\u2019s the CTO, it\u2019s the programmer, it\u2019s the software engineer, hardware engineer. But even in the laundry business, it could be the person who\u2019s building the laundry service, who is making the trains run on time, who\u2019s making sure all the clothes end up in the right place at the right time, and so on.\nThe other side of it is sales. Again, selling has a very broad definition. Selling doesn\u2019t necessarily just mean selling individual customers, but it can mean marketing, it can mean communicating, it can mean recruiting, it can mean raising money, it can mean inspiring people, it could mean doing PR. It\u2019s a broad umbrella category.\nThe Silicon Valley model is a builder and seller\nSo, generally, the Silicon Valley startup model tends to work best. It\u2019s not the only way, but it is probably the most common way, when you have two founders, one of whom is world class at selling, and one of whom is world class at building.\nExamples are, of course, Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak with Apple, Gates and Allen probably had similar responsibilities early on with Microsoft, Larry and Sergey probably broke down along those lines, although it\u2019s a little different there because that was a very technical product delivered to end users through a simple interface.\nBut generally, you will see this pattern repeated over and over. There\u2019s a builder and there\u2019s a seller. There\u2019s a CEO and CTO combo. And venture and technology investors are almost trained to look for this combo whenever possible. It\u2019s the magic combination.\nIf you can do both you will be unstoppable\nThe ultimate is when one individual can do both. That\u2019s when you get true superpowers. That\u2019s when you get people who can create entire industries.\nThe living example is Elon Musk. He may not necessarily be building the rockets himself, but he understands enough that he actually makes technical contributions. He understands the technology well enough that no one\u2019s going to snow him on it, and he\u2019s not running around making claims that he doesn\u2019t think he can\u2019t eventually deliver. He may be optimistic on the timelines but he thinks this is within reasonableness for delivery.\nEven Steve Jobs developed enough product skills and was involved enough in the product that he also operated in both of these domains. Larry Ellison started as a programmer and I think wrote the first version of Oracle, or was actually heavily involved in it.\nMarc Andreessen was also in this domain. He may not have had enough confidence in his sales skills, but he was the programmer who wrote Netscape Navigator, or a big chunk of it. So, I think the real giants in any field are the people who can both build and sell.\nI\u2019d rather teach an engineer marketing than a marketer engineering\nAnd usually the building is a thing that a sales person can\u2019t pick up later in life. It requires too much focused time. But a builder can pick up selling a little bit later, especially if they were already innately wired to be a good communicator. Bill Gates famously paraphrases this as, \u201cI\u2019d rather teach an engineer marketing, than a marketer engineering.\u201d\nI think if you start out with a building mentality and you have building skills and it\u2019s still early enough in your life, or you have enough focused time that you think you can learn selling, and you have some natural characteristics or you\u2019re a good salesperson, then you can double down on those.\nNow, your sales skills could be in a different than traditional domain. For example, let\u2019s say you\u2019re a really good engineer and then people are saying, well, now you need to be good at sales, well, you may not be good at hand-to-hand sales, but you may be a really good writer.\nAnd writing is a skill that can be learned much more easily than, say, in-person selling, and so you may just cultivate writing skills until you become a good online communicator and then use that for your sales.\nOn the other hand, it could just be that you\u2019re a good builder and you\u2019re bad at writing and you don\u2019t like communicating to mass audiences but you\u2019re good one-on-one, so then you might use your sales skills for recruiting or for fundraising, which are more one-on-one kinds of endeavors.\nThis is pointing out that if you\u2019re at the intersection of these two, don\u2019t despair because you\u2019re not going to be the best technologist and you\u2019re not going to be the best salesperson, but in a weird way, that combination, back to the Scott Adams skill stack, that combination of two skills is unstoppable.\nLong term, people who understand the underlying product and how to build it and can sell it, these are catnip to investors, these people can break down walls if they have enough energy, and they can get almost anything done.\nNivi: If you could only pick one to be good at, which one would you pick?\nNaval: When you\u2019re trying to stand out from the noise building is actually better because there\u2019re so many hustlers and sales people who have nothing to back them up. When you\u2019re starting out, when you\u2019re trying to be recognized, building is better.\nBut much later down the line building gets exhausting because it is a focus job and it\u2019s hard to stay current because there\u2019s always new people, new products coming up who have newer tools, and frankly more time because it\u2019s very intense, it\u2019s a very focused task.\nSo, sales skills actually scale better over time. Like for example, if you have a reputation for building a great product, that\u2019s good, but when you ship your new product, I\u2019m going to validate it based on the product. But if you have a reputation for being a good person to do business with and you\u2019re persuasive and communicative then that reputation almost becomes self-fulfilling.\nSo, I think if you only had to pick up one, you can start with building and then transition to selling. This is a cop-out answer, but I think that is actually the right answer.", "sentiment": 0, "pageUrl": "https://nav.al/build-sell", "date": "Sat, 30 Mar 2019 23:00:00 GMT", "person": "naval_ravikant"}, {"title": "Specific Knowledge Is Highly Creative or Technical", "text": "Naval: To the extent that specific knowledge is taught, it\u2019s on the job. It\u2019s through apprenticeships. And that\u2019s why the best businesses, the best careers are the apprenticeship or self-taught careers, because those are things society still has not figured out how to train and automate yet.\nThe classic line here is that Warren Buffett went to Benjamin Graham when he got out of school. Benjamin Graham was the author of the Intelligent Investor and sort of modernized or created value investing as a discipline. And Warren Buffett went to Benjamin Graham and offered to work for him for free.\nAnd Graham said, \u201cActually, you\u2019re overpriced, free is overpriced.\u201d And Graham was absolutely right. When it comes to a very valuable apprenticeship like the type that Graham was going to give Buffet, Buffet should have been paying him a lot of money. That right there tells you that those are skills worth having.\nSpecific knowledge is often highly creative or technical\nSpecific knowledge also tends to be technical and creative. It\u2019s on the bleeding edge of technology, on the bleeding edge of art, on the bleeding edge of communication.\nEven today, for example, there are probably meme lords out there on the Internet who can create incredible memes that will spread the idea to millions of people. Or are very persuasive \u2013 Scott Adams is a good example of this. He is essentially becoming one of the most credible people in the world by making accurate predictions through persuasive arguments and videos.\nAnd that is specific knowledge that he has built up over the years because he got obsessed with hypnosis when he was young, he learned how to communicate through cartooning, he embraced Periscope early, so he\u2019s been practicing lots of conversation, he\u2019s read all the books on the topic, he\u2019s employed it in his everyday life. If you look at his girlfriend, she\u2019s this beautiful young Instagram model.\nThat is an example of someone who has built up a specific knowledge over the course of his career. It\u2019s highly creative, it has elements of being technical in it, and it\u2019s something that is never going to be automated.\nNo one\u2019s going to take that away from him, because he\u2019s also accountable under one brand as Scott Adams, and he\u2019s operating with the leverage of media with Periscope and drawing Dilbert cartoons and writing books. He has massive leverage on top of that brand and he can build wealth out of it if he wanted to build additional wealth beyond what he already has.\nSpecific knowledge is specific to the individual and situation\nNivi: Should we be calling it unique knowledge or does specific knowledge somehow make more sense for it?\nNaval: You know, I came up with this framework when I was really young. We\u2019re talking decades and decades. It\u2019s now probably over 30 years old. So, at the time specific knowledge stuck with me so that is how I think about it.\nThe reason I didn\u2019t try and change it is because every other term that I found for it was overloaded in a different way. At least specific knowledge isn\u2019t that used. I can kind of rebrand it.\nThe problem with unique knowledge is, yeah, maybe it\u2019s unique but if I learn it from somebody else it\u2019s no longer unique, then we both know it. So, it\u2019s not so much that it is unique, it\u2019s that it is highly specific to the situation, it\u2019s specific to the individual, it\u2019s specific to the problem, and it can only be built as part of a larger obsession, interest, and time spent in that domain.\nIt can\u2019t just be read straight out of a single book, nor can it be taught in a single course, nor can it be programmed into a single algorithm.\nYou can\u2019t be too deliberate about assembling specific knowledge\nNivi: Speaking of Scott Adams, he\u2019s got a blog post on how to build your career by getting in, say, the top 25 percentile at three or more things. And by doing that, you become the only person in the world who can do those three things in the 25th percentile.\nSo, instead of trying to be the best at one thing, you just try to be very, very good at three or more things. Is that a way of building specific knowledge?\nNaval: I actually think the best way is just to follow your own obsession. And somewhere in the back of your mind, you can realize that, actually, this obsession I like and I\u2019ll keep an eye out for the commercial aspects of it.\nBut I think if you go around trying to build it a little too deliberately, if you become too goal-oriented on the money, then you won\u2019t pick the right thing. You won\u2019t actually pick the thing that you love to do, so you won\u2019t go deep enough into it.\nScott Adams\u2019 observation is a good one, predicated on statistics. Let\u2019s say there\u2019s 10,000 areas that are valuable to the human race today in terms of knowledge to have, and the number one in those 10,000 slots is taken.\nSomeone else is likely to be the number one in each of those 10,000, unless you happen to be one of the 10,000 most obsessed people in the world that at a given thing.\nBut when you start combining, well, number 3,728 with top-notch sales skills and really good writing skills and someone who understands accounting and finance really well, when the need for that intersection arrives, you\u2019ve expanded enough from 10,000 through combinatorics to millions or tens of millions. So, it just becomes much less competitive.\nAlso, there\u2019s diminishing returns. So, it\u2019s much easier to be top 5 percentile at three or four things than it is to be literally the number one at something.\nBuild specific knowledge where you are a natural\nI think it\u2019s a very pragmatic approach. But I think it\u2019s important that one not start assembling things too deliberately because you do want to pick things where you are a natural. Everyone is a natural at something.\nWe\u2019re all familiar with that phrase, a natural. \u201cOh, this person is a natural at meeting men or women, this person is a natural socialite, this person is a natural programmer, this person is a natural reader.\u201d So, whatever you are a natural at, you want to double down on that.\nAnd then there are probably multiple things you\u2019re natural at because personalities and humans are very complex. So, we want to be able to take the things that you are natural at and combine them so that you automatically, just through sheer interest and enjoyment, end up top 25% or top 10% or top 5% at a number of things.", "sentiment": 0.751, "pageUrl": "https://nav.al/creative-technical", "date": "Wed, 27 Mar 2019 23:00:00 GMT", "person": "naval_ravikant"}, {"title": "Arm Yourself With Specific Knowledge", "text": "Nivi: Do you want to talk a little bit about the skills that you need, in particular specific knowledge, accountability, leverage and judgment. So, the first tweet in this area is \u201cArm yourself with specific knowledge accountability and leverage.\u201d And I\u2019ll throw in judgment as well. I don\u2019t think you covered that in that particular tweet.\nNaval: If you want to make money you have to get paid at scale. And why you, that\u2019s accountability, at scale, that\u2019s leverage, and just you getting paid as opposed to somebody else getting paid , that\u2019s specific knowledge.\nSo, specific knowledge is probably the hardest thing to get across in this whole tweetstorm, and it\u2019s probably the thing that people get the most confused about.\nThe thing is that we have this idea that everything can be taught, everything can be taught in school. And it\u2019s not true that everything can be taught. In fact, the most interesting things cannot be taught.\nBut everything can be learned. And very often that learning either comes from some innate characteristics in your DNA, or it could be through your childhood where you learn soft skills which are very, very hard to teach later on in life, or it\u2019s something that is brand new so nobody else knows how to do it either, or it\u2019s true on the job training because you\u2019re pattern matching into highly complex environments, basically building judgment in a specific domain.\nClassic example is investing, but it could be in anything. It could be in judgment in running a fleet of trucks, it could be judgment in weather forecasting.\nSo, specific knowledge is the knowledge that you care about. Especially if you\u2019re later in life, let\u2019s say your post 20, 21, 22, you almost don\u2019t get to choose which specific knowledge you have. Rather, you get to look at what you have already built by that point in time, and then you can build on top of it.\nSpecific knowledge can\u2019t be trained\nThe first thing to notice about specific knowledge is that you can\u2019t be trained for it. If you can be trained for it, if you can go to a class and learn specific knowledge, then somebody else can be trained for it too, and then we can mass-produce and mass-train people. Heck, we can even program computers to do it and eventually we can program robots to walk around doing it.\nSo, if that\u2019s the case, then you\u2019re extremely replaceable and all we have to pay you is the minimum wage that we have to pay you to get you to do it when there are lots of other takers who can be trained to do it. So really, your returns just devolve into your cost of training plus the return on investment on that training.\nSo, you really want to pick up specific knowledge, you need your schooling, you need your training to be able to capitalize on the best specific knowledge, but the part of it that you\u2019re going to get paid for is the specific knowledge.\nSpecific knowledge is found by pursuing your curiosity\nFor example, someone who goes and gets a degree in psychology and then becomes a salesperson. Well if they were already a formidable salesperson, a high grade salesmanship to begin with, then the psychology degree is leverage, it arms them and they do much better at sales.\nBut if they were always an introvert never very good at sales and they\u2019re trying to use psychology to learn sales, they\u2019re just not going to get that great at it.\nSo, specific knowledge is found much more by pursuing your innate talents, your genuine curiosity, and your passion. It\u2019s not by going to school for whatever is the hottest job, it\u2019s not for going into whatever field investors say is the hottest.\nVery often specific knowledge is at the edge of knowledge. It\u2019s also stuff that\u2019s just being figured out or is really hard to figure out.\nSo, if you\u2019re not 100% into it somebody else who is 100% into it will outperform you. And they won\u2019t just outperform you by a little bit, they\u2019ll outperform you by a lot because now we\u2019re operating the domain of ideas, compound interest really applies and leverage really applies.\nSo, if you\u2019re operating with 1,000 times leverage and somebody is right 80% of the time, and somebody else is right 90% of time, the person who\u2019s right 90% of the time will literally get paid hundreds of times more by the market because of the leverage and because of the compounding factors and being correct. So, you really want to make sure you\u2019re good at it so that genuine curiosity is very important.\nBuilding specific knowledge will feel like play to you\nSo, very often, it\u2019s not something you sit down and then you reason about, it\u2019s more found by observation. You almost have to look back on your own life and see what you\u2019re actually good at.\nFor example, I wanted to be a scientist and that is where a lot of my moral hierarchy comes from. I view scientists sort of at the top of the production chain for humanity. And the group of scientists who have made real breakthroughs and contributions that probably added more to human society, I think, than any single other class of human beings.\nNot to take away anything from art or politics or engineering or business, but without the science we\u2019d still be scrambling in the dirt fighting with sticks and trying to start fires.\nMy whole value system was built around scientists and I wanted to be a great scientist. But when I actually look back at what I was uniquely good at and what I ended up spending my time doing, it was more around making money, tinkering with technology, and selling people on things. Explaining things, talking to people.\nSo, I have some sales skills, which is a form specific knowledge that I have. I have some analytical skills around how to make money. And I have this ability to absorb data, obsess about it, and break it down and that is a specific skill that I have. I also just love tinkering with technology. And all of this stuff feels like play to me, but it looks like work to others.\nSo, there are other people to whom these things would be hard and they say like, \u201cWell, how do I get good at being pithy and selling ideas?\u201d Well, if you\u2019re not already good at it or if you\u2019re not really into it, maybe it\u2019s not your thing, focus on the thing that you are really into.\nThis is ironic, but the first person to actually point out my real specific knowledge was my mother. She did it as an aside, talking from the kitchen and she said it when I was like 15 or 16 years old. I was telling a friend of mine that I want to be an astrophysicist and she said, \u201cNo, you\u2019re going to go into business.\u201d\nI was like, \u201cWhat, my mom\u2019s telling me I\u2019m going to be in business. I\u2019m going to be an astrophysicist. Mom doesn\u2019t know she\u2019s talking about.\u201d But mom knew exactly what she was talking about.\nShe\u2019d already observed that every time we walk down the street, I would critique the local pizza parlor on why they were selling their slices a certain way with certain toppings and why their process of ordering was this way when it should have been that way.\nSo, she knew that I had more of a business curious mind, but then my obsession with science combined to create technology and technology businesses where I found myself.\nSo, very often, your specific knowledge is observed and often observed by other people who know you well and revealed in situations rather than something that you come up with.\nRelated", "sentiment": 0, "pageUrl": "https://nav.al/specific-knowledge", "date": "Sun, 24 Mar 2019 23:00:00 GMT", "person": "naval_ravikant"}, {"title": "Partner With Rational Optimists", "text": "Nivi: Let\u2019s do this last tweet. You said, \u201cDon\u2019t partner with cynics, and pessimists. Their beliefs are self-fulfilling.\u201d\nNaval: Yes. Essentially, to create things, you have to be a rational optimist. Rational in the sense that you have to see the world for what it really is. And yet you have to be optimistic about your own capabilities, and your capability to get things done.\nWe all know people who are consistently pessimistic, who will shoot down everything. Everyone in their life has the helpful critical guy, right? He thinks he\u2019s being helpful, but he\u2019s actually being critical, and he\u2019s a downer on everything.\nThat person will not only never do anything great in their lives, they\u2019ll prevent other people around them from doing something great. They think their job is to shoot holes in things. And it\u2019s okay to shoot holes in things as long as you come up with a solution.\nThere\u2019s also the classic military line, \u201cEither lead, follow, or get out of the way.\u201d And these people want a fourth option, where they don\u2019t want to lead, they don\u2019t want to follow, but they don\u2019t want to get out of the way. They want to tell you why the thing is not going to work.\nAnd all the really successful people I know have a very strong action bias. They just do things. The easiest way to figure out if something is viable or not is by doing it. At least do the first step, and the second step, and the third, and then decide.\nSo, if you want to be successful in life, creating wealth, or having good relationships, or being fit, or even being happy, you need to have an action bias towards getting what you want.\nPartner with rational optimists\nAnd you have to be optimistic about it. Not irrationally. You know, there\u2019s nothing worse than someone who is foolhardy and chasing something that\u2019s not worth it.\nThat\u2019s why I say rational optimist. But you have to be rational. Know all the pitfalls. Know the downsides, but still keep your chin up.\nYou\u2019ve got one life on this planet. Why not try to build something big? This is the beauty of Elon Musk, and why I think he inspires so many people, it\u2019s just because he takes on really, really big audacious tasks. And he provides an example for people to think big.\nAnd it takes a lot of work to build even small things. I don\u2019t think the corner grocery store owner is working any less hard than Elon Musk, or pouring any less sweat and toil into it. Maybe even more.\nBut for whatever reason, education, circumstance, they didn\u2019t get the chance to think as big, so the outcome is not as big. So, it\u2019s just better to think big. Obviously, rationally, within your means, stay optimistic.\nThe cynics and the pessimists, what they\u2019re really saying, it\u2019s unfortunate, but they\u2019re basically saying, \u201cI\u2019ve given up. I don\u2019t think I can do anything. And so the world to me just looks like a world where nobody can do anything. And so why should you go do something because if you fail, then I\u2019m right, which is great. But if you succeed, then you just make me look bad.\u201d\nWe\u2019re descended from pessimists\nNivi: Yes, it\u2019s probably better to be an irrational optimist, then it is to be a rational cynic.\nNaval: There\u2019s a completely rational frame on why you should be an optimist. Historically, if you go back 2,000 years, 5,000 years, 10,000 years, two people are wandering through a jungle, they hear a tiger. One\u2019s an optimist, and says, \u201cOh, it\u2019s not headed our way.\u201d The other one says, \u201cI\u2019m a pessimist, I\u2019m out of here.\u201d And the pessimist runs and survives, and the optimist gets eaten.\nSo, we\u2019re descended from pessimists. We\u2019re genetically hardwired to be pessimists. But modern society is far, far safer. There are no tigers wandering around the street. It\u2019s very unlikely that you will end up in total ruin, although you should avoid total ruin.\nMuch more likely that the upside is unlimited, and the downside is limited. So, adapting for modern society means overriding your pessimism, and taking slightly irrationally optimistic bets because the upside is unlimited if you start the next SpaceX, or Tesla, or Uber, you can make billions of dollars of value for society, and for yourself, and change the world.\nAnd if you fail, what\u2019s the big deal? You lost a few million dollars of investor money, and they\u2019ve got plenty more, and that\u2019s the bet they take on the chances that you will succeed.\nIt made sense to be pessimistic in the past. It makes sense to be optimistic today, especially if you\u2019re educated and living in a First World country. Even a Third World country. I actually think the economic opportunities in Third World countries are much larger.\nThe one thing you have to avoid is the risk of ruin. Ruin means stay out of jail. So, don\u2019t do anything that\u2019s illegal. It\u2019s never worth it to wear an orange jumpsuit. And stay out of total catastrophic loss. That could mean that you stay out of things that could be physically dangerous, hurt your body.\nYou have to watch your health. And stay out of things that can cause you to lose all of your capital, all of your savings. So, don\u2019t gamble everything on one go. But take rationally optimistic bets with big upside.\nBOCTAOE\nNivi: I think there\u2019s people that will try and build up your ideas, and build on your ideas, no matter how far fetched they might seem. And then there are people who list all of the obvious exceptions, no matter how obvious they are.\nAnd fortunately in the startup world, I don\u2019t even really get exposed to the people that are giving you the obvious exceptions, and all the reasons it\u2019s not going to work. I barely get exposed to that anymore.\nNaval: That\u2019s what Twitter is for. Scott Adams got so annoyed by this that he came up with a phrase, an acronym, which is \u201cbut of course there are obvious exceptions\u201d, BOCTAOE. And he used to pin that acronym at the end of his articles for a while.\nBut Twitter is overrun with nitpickers. Whereas exactly as you were pointing out, Silicon Valley has learned that the upside is so great that you never look down on the kid who\u2019s wearing a hoodie and has coffee on his shoes. And just looks like a slob because you don\u2019t know if he\u2019s going to be the next Mark Zuckerberg, or the next Reid Hoffman.\nSo, you\u2019ve got to treat everybody with respect. You\u2019ve got to look up to every possibility, and opportunity because the upside is so unlimited, and the downside is so limited in the modern world, especially with financial assets and instruments.", "sentiment": -0.876, "pageUrl": "https://nav.al/rational-optimists", "date": "Thu, 21 Mar 2019 23:00:00 GMT", "person": "naval_ravikant"}, {"title": "Pick Partners With Intelligence, Energy and Integrity", "text": "Naval: In terms of picking people to work with, pick ones that have high intelligence, high energy, and high integrity, I find that\u2019s the three-part checklist that you cannot compromise on.\nYou need someone who is smart, or they\u2019ll head in the wrong direction. And you\u2019re not going to end up in the right place. You need someone high-energy because the world is full of smart, lazy people.\nWe all know people in our life who are really smart, but can\u2019t get out of bed, or lift a finger. And we also know people who are very high energy, but not that smart. So, they work hard, but they\u2019re sort of running in the wrong direction.\nAnd smart is not a pejorative. It\u2019s not meant to say someone is smart, someone else is stupid. But it\u2019s more that everyone is smart at different things. So, depending on what you want to do well, you have to find someone who is smart at that thing.\nAnd then energy, a lot of times people are unmotivated for a specific thing, but they\u2019re motivated for other things. So, for example, someone might be really unmotivated to go to a job, and sit in an office. But they might be really motivated to go paint, right?\nWell, in that case they should be a painter. They should be putting art up on the internet. Trying to figure out how to build a career out of that, rather than wearing a collar around their neck, and going to a dreary job.\nAnd then high integrity is the most important because otherwise if you\u2019ve got the other two, what you have is you have a smart and hard working crook, who\u2019s eventually going to cheat you. So, you have to figure out if the person is high-integrity.\nAnd as we talked about, the way you do that is through signals. And signals is what they do, not what they say. It\u2019s all the non-verbal stuff that they do when they think nobody is looking.\nMotivation has to come intrinsically\nNivi: With respect to the energy, there was this interesting thing from Sam Altman a while back, where he was talking about delegation, and he was saying, \u201cOne of the important things for delegation is, delegate to people who are actually good at the thing that you want them to do.\u201d\nIt\u2019s the most obvious thing, but it seems like\u2026 you want to partner with people who are naturally going to do the things that you want them to do.\nNaval: Yeah. I almost won\u2019t start a company, or hire a person, or work with somebody if I just don\u2019t think they\u2019re into what I want them to do.\nWhen I was younger, I used to try and talk people into things. I had this idea that you could sell someone into doing something. But you can\u2019t. You can\u2019t keep them motivated. You can get them inspired initially. It might work if you\u2019re a king like Henry V, and you\u2019re trying to get them to just charge into battle, and then they\u2019ll figure it out.\nBut if you\u2019re trying to keep someone motivated for the long-term, that motivation has to come intrinsically. You can\u2019t just create it, nor can you be the crutch for them if they don\u2019t have that intrinsic motivation. So, you have to make sure people actually are high-energy, and want to do what you want them to do, and what you want to work with them on.\nIntegrity is what someone does, despite what they say they do\nReading signals is very, very important. Signals are what people do despite what they say. So, it\u2019s important to pay attention to subtle signals. We all know that socially if someone treats a waiter, or waitress in a restaurant really badly, then it\u2019s only a matter of time until they treat you badly.\nIf somebody screws over an enemy, and is vindictive towards them, well it\u2019s only a matter of time before they redefine you from friend to enemy, and you feel their wrath. So, angry, outraged, vindictive, short-term thinking people are essentially that way in many interactions in real life.\nPeople are oddly consistent. That\u2019s one of the things you learn about them. So, you want to find long-term people. You want to find people who seem irrationally ethical.\nFor example, I had a friend of mine whose company I invested in, and the company failed, and he could have wiped out all of the investors. But he kept putting more and more personal money in. Through three different pivots he put personal money in until the company finally succeeded. And in the process, he never wiped out the investors.\nAnd I was always grateful to him for that. I said, \u201cWow, that\u2019s amazing that you were so good to your investors. You didn\u2019t wipe them out.\u201d And he got offended by that. He said, \u201cI didn\u2019t do it for you. I didn\u2019t do it for my investors. I did it for me. It\u2019s my own self-esteem. It\u2019s what I care about. That\u2019s how I live my life.\u201d That\u2019s the kind of person you want to work with.\nAnother quote that I like, I have a tweet on this. I think I read this somewhere else, so I\u2019m not taking credit for this. But I kind of modified it a little bit. Which is that \u201cself-esteem is the reputation that you have with yourself.\u201d You\u2019ll always know.\nSo, good people, moral people, ethical people, easy to work with people, reliable people, tend to have very high self-esteem because they have very good reputations with themselves, and they understand that.\nIt\u2019s not ego. Self-esteem and ego are different things. Because ego can be undeserved, but self-esteem at least you feel like you lived up to your own internal moral code of ethics.\nAnd so it\u2019s very hard to work with people who end up being low integrity. And it\u2019s hard to figure out who is high integrity and low integrity. Generally, the more someone is saying that they\u2019re moral, ethical, and high integrity, the less likely they are to be that way.\nIt\u2019s very much like status signalling. If you overtly bid for status, if you overtly talk about being high status, that is a low status move. If you openly talk about how honest, reliable, and trustworthy you are, you\u2019re probably not that honest and trustworthy. That is a characteristic of con men.\nSo, yeah, pick an industry in which you can play long-term games with long-term people.", "sentiment": 0.815, "pageUrl": "https://nav.al/intelligence-energy-integrity", "date": "Thu, 21 Mar 2019 23:00:00 GMT", "person": "naval_ravikant"}, {"title": "Play Long-term Games With Long-term People", "text": "Nivi: Talk a little bit about what industries you should think about working in. What kind of job you should have? And who you might want to work with? So, you said, \u201cOne should pick an industry where you can play long-term games with long-term people.\u201d Why?\nNaval: Yeah, this is an insight into what makes Silicon Valley work, and what makes high trust societies work. Essentially, all the benefits in life come from compound interests. Whether it\u2019s in relationships, or making money, or in learning.\nSo, compound interest is a marvelous force, where if you start out with 1x what you have, and then if you increase 20% a year for 30 years, it\u2019s not that you got 30 years times 20% added on. It was compounding, so it just grew, and grew, and grew until you suddenly got a massive amount of whatever it is. Whether it\u2019s goodwill, or love, or relationships, or money. So, I think compound interest is a very important force.\nYou have to be able to play a long-term game. And long-term games are good not just for compound interest, they\u2019re also good for trust. If you look at prisoner\u2019s dilemma type games, a solution to prisoner\u2019s dilemma is tit-for-tat, which is I\u2019m just going do to you what you did last time to me, with some forgiveness in case there was a mistake made. But that only works in an iterated prisoner\u2019s dilemma, in another words if we play a game multiple times.\nSo, if you\u2019re in a situation, like for example you\u2019re in Silicon Valley, where people are doing business with each other, and they know each other, they trust each other. Then they do right by each other because they know this person will be around for the next game.\nNow of course that doesn\u2019t always work because you can make so much money in one move in Silicon Valley, sometimes people betray each other because they\u2019re just like, \u201cI\u2019m going to get rich enough off this that I don\u2019t care.\u201d So, there can be exceptions to all these circumstances.\nBut essentially if you want to be successful, you have to work with other people. And you have to figure out who can you trust, and who can you trust over a long, long period of time, that you can just keep playing the game with them, so that compound interest, and high trust will make it easier to play the game, and will let you collect the major rewards, which are usually at the end of the cycle.\nSo, for example, Warren Buffett has done really well as an investor in the U.S. stock market, but the biggest reason he could do that was because the U.S. stock market has been stable, and around, and didn\u2019t get for example seized by the government during a bad administration. Or the U.S. didn\u2019t plunge into some war. The underlying platform didn\u2019t get destroyed. So, in his case, he was playing a longterm game. And the trust came from the U.S. stock market\u2019s stability.\nWhen you switch industries, you\u2019re starting over from scratch\nIn Silicon Valley, the trust comes from the network of people in the small geographic area, that you figure out over time who you can work with, and who you can\u2019t.\nIf you keep switching locations, you keep switching groups\u2026 let\u2019s say you started out in the woodworking industry, and you built up a network there. And you\u2019re working hard, you\u2019re trying to build a product in the woodworking industry. And then suddenly another industry comes along that\u2019s adjacent but different, but you don\u2019t really know anybody in it, and you want to dive in, and make money there.\nIf you keep hopping from industry to \u2026 \u201cNo, actually I need to open a line of electric car stations for electric car refueling.\u201d That might make sense. That might be the best opportunity. But every time you reset, every time you wander out of where you built your network, you\u2019re going to be starting from scratch. You\u2019re not going to know who to trust. They\u2019re not going to know to trust you.\nThere are also industries in which people are transient by definition. They\u2019re always coming in and going out. Politics is an example of that, right? In politics new people are being elected. You see in politics that when you have a lot of old-timers, like the Senate, people who have been around for a long time, and they\u2019ve been career politicians.\nThere\u2019s a lot of downside to career politicians like corruption. But an upside is they actually get deals done with each other because they know the other person is going to be in the same position ten years from now, and they\u2019re going to have to keep dealing with them, so they might as well learn how to cooperate.\nWhereas every time you get a new incoming freshman class in the House of Representatives, which turns over every two years with a big wave election. Nothing gets done because of a lot fighting. \u201cBecause I just got here, I don\u2019t know you, I don\u2019t know if you\u2019re going to be around, why should I work with you rather than just try to do whatever I think is right?\u201d\nSo, it\u2019s important to pick an industry where you can play long-term games, and with long-term people. So, those people have to signal that they\u2019re going to be around for a long time. That they\u2019re ethical. And their ethics are visible through their actions.\nLong-term players make each other rich\nNivi: In a long-term game, it seems that everybody is making each other rich. And in a short-term game, it seems like everybody is making themselves rich.\nNaval: I think that is a brilliant formulation. In a longterm game, it\u2019s positive sum. We\u2019re all baking the pie together. We\u2019re trying to make it as big as possible. And in a short term game, we\u2019re cutting up the pie.\nNow this is not to excuse the socialists, right? The socialists are the people who are not involved in baking the pie, who show up at the end, and say, \u201cI want a slice, or I want the whole pie.\u201d They show up with the guns.\nBut I think a good leader doesn\u2019t take credit. A good leader basically tries to inspire people, so the team gets the job done. And then things get divided up according to fairness, and who contributed how much, or as close to it as possible, and took a risk, as opposed to just whoever has the longest knife\u2026 the sharpest knife at the end.\nReturns come from compound interest in iterated games\nNivi: So, these next two tweets are, \u201cPlay iterated games. All returns in life, whether in wealth, relationships, or knowledge come from compound interest.\u201d\nNaval: When you have been doing business with somebody, you\u2019ve been friends with somebody for ten years, twenty years, thirty years, it just gets better and better because you trust them so easily. The friction goes down, you can do bigger, and bigger things together.\nFor example, the simplest one is getting married to someone, and having kids, and raising children. That\u2019s compound interest, right? Investing in those relationships. Those relationships end up being invaluable compared to more casual relationships.\nIt\u2019s true in health and fitness. You know, the fitter you are, the easier it is to stay fit. Whereas the more you deteriorate your body, the harder it is to come back, and claw your way back to a baseline. It requires heroic acts.\nNivi: Regarding compound interest, I think I saw retweet something a while back. Maybe it was from Ed Latimore. It went something along the lines of, \u201cGet some traction. Get purchase, and don\u2019t lose it\u201d [correction: the tweet is by @mmay3r]. So, the idea was to gain some initial traction, and never fall back, just keep ratcheting up, and up.\nNaval: I don\u2019t remember it exactly. But I think that was right. Yes, it was like, \u201cGet traction, and don\u2019t let go.\u201d It was a good one, yes.\nRelated", "sentiment": 0, "pageUrl": "https://nav.al/long-term", "date": "Mon, 18 Mar 2019 23:00:00 GMT", "person": "naval_ravikant"}, {"title": "The Internet Has Massively Broadened Career Possibilities", "text": "Nivi: Let\u2019s look at this next tweet, which I thought was cryptic, and also super interesting, about the kind of job or career that you might have. You said, \u201cThe internet has massively broadened the possible space of careers. Most people haven\u2019t figured this out yet.\u201d\nNaval: The fundamental property of the internet more than any other single thing is it connects every human to each other human on the planet. You can now reach everyone.\nWhether it\u2019s by emailing them personally, whether it\u2019s by broadcasting to them on Twitter, whether it\u2019s by posting something on Facebook that they find, whether it\u2019s by putting up a website they come and access.\nIt connects everyone to everyone. So, the internet is an inter-networking tool. It connects everybody. That is its superpower. So, you want to use that.\nWhat that helps you figure out is the internet means you can find your audience for your product, or your talent, and skill no matter how far away they are.\nFor example, Nenad, who is Illacertus, if you look at his videos pre-internet, how would he get the message out there? It would just be \u2026 what would he do? He would run around where he lives in his neighborhood showing it to people on a computer, or a screen? Or he would try to get it played at his local movie theater? It was impossible. It only works because he can put it on the internet.\nAnd then how many people in the world are really interested in it? Or even in interested in what we\u2019re talking about are really gonna absorb it, right? It\u2019s gonna be a very small subset of humanity. The key is being able to reach them.\nThe Internet allows you to scale any niche obsession\nSo, what the internet does is allows any niche obsession, which could be just the weirdest thing. It could be like people who collect snakes, to like people who like to ride hot air balloons, to people who like to sail around the world by themselves, just one person on a craft, or someone who\u2019s obsessed with miniature cooking. Like, there\u2019s this whole Japanese miniature cooking phenomenon. Or there\u2019s a show about a woman who goes in people\u2019s houses, and tidies it up, right?\nSo, whatever niche obsession you have, the internet allows you to scale. Now that\u2019s not to say that what you build will be the next Facebook, or reach billions of users, but if you just want to reach 50,000 passionate people like you, there\u2019s an audience out there for you.\nSo the beauty of this is that we have 7 billion human beings on the planet. The combinatorics of human DNA are incredible. Everyone is completely different. You\u2019ll never meet any two people who are even vaguely similar to each other, that can substitute for each other.\nIt\u2019s not like you can say, \u201cWell, Nivi, just left my life. So, I can have this other person come in, and he\u2019s just like Nivi. And I get the same feelings, and the same responses, and the same ideas.\u201d No. There are no substitutes for people. People are completely unique.\nSo, given that each person has different skillsets, different interests, different obsessions. And it\u2019s that diversity that becomes a creative superpower. So, each person can be creatively superb at their own unique thing.\nBut before that didn\u2019t matter. Because if you were living in a little fishing village in Italy, like your fishing village didn\u2019t necessarily need your completely unique skill, and you had to conform to just the few jobs that were available. But now today you can be completely unique.\nYou can go out on the internet, and you can find your audience. And you can build a business, and create a product, and build wealth, and make people happy just uniquely expressing yourself through the internet.\nThe space of careers has been so broadened. E-sports players, you know, people making millions of dollars playing Fortnite. People creating videos, and uploading them. YouTube broadcasters. Bloggers, podcasters. Joe Rogan, I read, true or false, I don\u2019t know, but I read that he\u2019s gonna make about $100 million a year on his podcast. And he\u2019s had 2 billion downloads.\nEven PewDiePie\u2026 there\u2019s a hilarious tweet that I retweeted the other day. PewDiePie is the number one trusted name in news. This is a kid I think in Sweden, and he\u2019s got three times the distribution of the top cable news networks. Just on his news channel. It\u2019s not even on his entertainment channel.\nEscape competition through authenticity\nThe internet enables any niche interest, as long as you\u2019re the best at it to scale out. And the great news is because every human is different, everyone is the best at something. Being themselves.\nAnother tweet I had that is worth kind of weaving in, but didn\u2019t go into this tweetstorm, was a very simple one. I like things when I can compress them down because they\u2019re easy to remember, and easy to hook onto. But that one was, \u201cEscape competition through authenticity.\u201d\nBasically, when you\u2019re competing with people it\u2019s because you\u2019re copying them. It\u2019s because you\u2019re trying to do the same thing. But every human is different. Don\u2019t copy.\nI know we\u2019re mimetic creatures, and Ren\u00e9 Girard has a whole mimesis theory. But it\u2019s much easier than that. Don\u2019t imitate. Don\u2019t copy. Just do your own thing. No one can compete with you on being you. It\u2019s that simple.\nAnd so the more authentic you are to who you are, and what you love to do, the less competition you\u2019re gonna have. So, you can escape competition through authenticity when you realize that no one can compete with you on being you. And normally that would have been useless advice pre-internet. Post-internet you can turn that into a career.\nRelated", "sentiment": 0, "pageUrl": "https://nav.al/possible-careers", "date": "Mon, 18 Mar 2019 23:00:00 GMT", "person": "naval_ravikant"}, {"title": "Give Society What It Doesn\u2019t Know How to Get", "text": "Nivi: You\u2019re not gonna get rich renting out your time.

So, essentially as we talked about before, money is IOUs from society saying, \u201cYou did something good in the past. Now here\u2019s something that we owe you for the future.\u201d And so society will pay you for creating things that it wants.\nBut society doesn\u2019t yet know how to create those things because if it did, they wouldn\u2019t need you. They would already be stamped out big time.\nAlmost everything that\u2019s in your house, in your workplace, and on the street used to be technology at one point in time. There was a time when oil was a technology, that made J.D. Rockefeller rich. There was a time when cars were technology, that made Henry Ford rich.\nSo, technology is just the set of things, as Alan Kay said, that don\u2019t quite work yet [correction: Danny Hillis]. Once something works, it\u2019s no longer technology. So, society always wants new things.\nFigure out what product you can provide and then figure out how to scale it\nAnd if you want to be wealthy, you want to figure out which one of those things you can provide for society, that it does not yet know how to get, but it will want, that\u2019s natural to you, and within your skillset, within your capabilities.\nAnd then you have to figure out how to scale it. Because if you just build one of it, that\u2019s not enough. You\u2019ve got to build thousands, or hundreds of thousands, or millions, or billions of them. So, everybody can have one.\nSteve Jobs, and his team of course figured out that society would want smartphones. A computer in their pocket that had all the phone capability times 100, and be easy to use. So, they figured out how to build that, and then they figured out how to scale it.\nAnd they figured out how to get one into every First World citizen\u2019s pocket, and eventually every Third World citizen too. And so because of that they\u2019re handsomely rewarded, and Apple is the most valuable company in the world.\nNivi: The way I tried to put it was that the entrepreneur\u2019s job is to try to bring the high end to the mass market.\nNaval: It starts as high end. First it starts as an act of creativity. First you create it just because you want it. You want it, and you know how to build it, and you need it. And so you build it for yourself. Then you figure out how to get it to other people. And then for a little while rich people have it.\nLike, for example rich people had chauffeurs, and then they had black town cars. And then Uber came along, and everyone\u2019s private driver is available to everybody. And now you can even see Uber pools that are replacing shuttle buses because it\u2019s more convenient. And then you get scooters, which are even further down market of that. So, you\u2019re right. It\u2019s about distributing what rich people used to have to everybody.\nBut the entrepreneur\u2019s job starts even before that, which is creation.

You must own equity\u2014a piece of the business\u2014to gain your financial freedom.\u201d\nNaval: This is probably one of the absolute most important points. People seem to think that you can create wealth, and make money through work. And it\u2019s probably not going to work. There are many reasons for that.\nBut the most basic is just that your inputs are very closely tied to your outputs. In almost any salaried job, even at one that\u2019s paying a lot per hour like a lawyer, or a doctor, you\u2019re still putting in the hours, and every hour you get paid.\nSo, what that means is when you\u2019re sleeping, you\u2019re not earning. When you\u2019re retired, you\u2019re not earning. When you\u2019re on vacation, you\u2019re not earning. And you can\u2019t earn non-linearly.\nIf you look at even doctors who get rich, like really rich, it\u2019s because they open a business. They open like a private practice. And that private practice builds a brand, and that brand attracts people. Or they build some kind of a medical device, or a procedure, or a process with an intellectual property.\nSo, essentially you\u2019re working for somebody else, and that person is taking on the risk, and has the accountability, and the intellectual property, and the brand. So, they\u2019re just not gonna pay you enough. They\u2019re gonna pay you the bare minimum that they have to, to get you to do their job. And that can be a high bare minimum, but it\u2019s still not gonna be true wealth where you\u2019re retired.\nRenting out your time means you\u2019re essentially replaceable\nAnd then finally you\u2019re actually just not even creating that much original for society. Like I said, this tweetstorm should have been called \u201cHow to Create Wealth.\u201d It\u2019s just \u201cHow to Get Rich\u201d was a more catchy title. But you\u2019re not creating new things for society. You\u2019re just doing things over and over.\nAnd you\u2019re essentially replaceable because you\u2019re now doing a set role. Most set roles can be taught. If they can be taught like in a school, then eventually you\u2019re gonna be competing with someone who\u2019s got more recent knowledge, who\u2019s been taught, and is coming in to replace you.\nYou\u2019re much more likely to be doing a job that can be eventually replaced by a robot, or by an AI. And it doesn\u2019t even have to be wholesale replaced over night. It can be replaced a little bit at a time. And that kind of eats into your wealth creation, and therefore your earning capability.\nSo, fundamentally your inputs are matched to your outputs. You are replaceable, and you\u2019re not being creative. I just don\u2019t think that, that is a way that you can truly make money.\nYou must own equity to gain your financial freedom\nSo everybody who really makes money at some point owns a piece of a product, or a business, or some kind of IP. That can be through stock options, so you can be working at a tech company. That\u2019s a fine way to start.\nBut usually the real wealth is created by starting your own companies, or by even investors. They\u2019re in an investment firm, and they\u2019re buying equity. These are much more the routes to wealth. It doesn\u2019t come through the hours.\nYou want a career where your inputs don\u2019t match your outputs\nYou really just want a job, or a career, or a profession where your inputs don\u2019t match your outputs. If you look at modern society, again this is later in the tweetstorm. Businesses that have high creativity and high leverage tends to be ones where you could do an hour of work, and it can have a huge effect. Or you can do 1,000 hours of work, and it can have no effect.\nFor example, look at software engineering. One great engineer can for example create bitcoin, and create billions of dollars worth of value. And an engineer who is working on the wrong thing, or not quite as good, or just not as creative, or thoughtful, or whatever, can work for an entire a year, and every piece of code they ship ends up not getting used. Customers don\u2019t want it.\nThat is an example of a profession where the input and the outputs are highly disconnected. It\u2019s not based on the number of hours that you put in.\nWhereas on the extreme other end, if you\u2019re a lumberjack, even the best lumberjack in the world, assuming you\u2019re not working with tools, so the inputs and outputs are clearly connected. You\u2019re just using an ax, or a saw. You know, the best lumberjack in the world may be like 3x better than one of the worst lumberjacks, right? It\u2019s not gonna be a gigantic difference.\nSo, you want to look for professions and careers where the inputs and outputs are highly disconnected. This is another way of saying that you want to look for things that are leveraged. And by leveraged I don\u2019t mean financial leveraged alone, like Wall Street uses, and that has a bad name. I\u2019m just talking about tools. We\u2019re using tools.\nA computer is a tool that software engineers use. If I\u2019m a lumberjack with bulldozers, and automatic robot axes, and saws, I\u2019m gonna be using tools, and have more leverage than someone who is just using his bare hands, and trying to rip the trees out by the roots.\nTools and leverage are what create this disconnection between inputs and outputs. Creativity, so the higher the creativity component of a profession, the more likely it is to have disconnected inputs and outputs.\nSo, I think that if you\u2019re looking at professions where your inputs and your outputs are highly connected, it\u2019s gonna be very, very, hard to create wealth, and make wealth for yourself in that process.\nRelated", "sentiment": -0.681, "pageUrl": "https://nav.al/renting-time", "date": "Thu, 07 Mar 2019 23:00:00 GMT", "person": "naval_ravikant"}, {"title": "On Humility", "text": "", "sentiment": 0.722, "pageUrl": "https://nav.al/on-humility", "date": "Thu, 03 Jan 2019 23:00:00 GMT", "person": "naval_ravikant"}, {"title": "On Meditation", "text": "", "sentiment": null, "pageUrl": "https://nav.al/on-meditation", "date": "Thu, 03 Jan 2019 23:00:00 GMT", "person": "naval_ravikant"}, {"title": "There is No Angel Bubble. There are Many Angel Bubbles.", "text": "A common meme floating around right now is that there is an Angel investing bubble.\nIn the sense that an enormous amount of capital is being placed at risk, and its popping will have grave macro-economic consequences, No.\nThe total amount of additional capital flowing through the Silicon Valley early-stage ecosystem, thanks to Super-Angels and newly minted millionaires, is on the order of half-a-billion dollars or so. It\u2019s no more than a middling-sized VC fund. Would the emergence of a new VC fund be considered a bubble? Would the collapse of one signal disaster?\nFurthermore, most of this capital is replacing traditional Series A deals. As we say around here, \u201cSeed is the New Series A.\u201d The same companies that needed $3M to launch now need $30K-$300K to launch. So, it\u2019s not surprising that there are many more of them.\nOk, but could that mean that the amount of capital for funding startups in the old environment is too much for the new environment? That the total supply of early-stage funding dollars should come down by a factor of ten rather than the number of companies being funded go up by a factor of ten?\nThis one is harder to ascertain, but my sense is that if there\u2019s too much capital, it\u2019s not an overwhelming overhang. Most of the small companies being funded will fail, but the ones that hit will generate fantastic returns. And because of their small size and operating costs, a greater percentage will be able to get \u201cramen profitable\u201d than was traditionally possible. Of course, actual exits might still be rare. The volume of small M&A deals hasn\u2019t scaled with the volume of Angel investments in small companies. I think we\u2019re all going to have to become even more comfortable with failures, re-starts, and the kind of team re-combination that one sees from one Y Combinator Demo Day to the next.\nOne thing that has been happening is that Angel investment valuations have been climbing very quickly \u2013 un-sustainably so. Twenty companies in an Investors\u2019 portfolio carried at a valuation of X might now suddenly be twenty small bubbles at a valuation of 2x. They may not be able to clear their valuation in a micro-acquisition, or lead to a down-round in a VC financing, or just give a sub-par return for what might otherwise have been a hit. Prices on the margin *have* been rising, and that will hurt returns.\nPrices have been rising not because of a huge influx of money (no big, macro bubble), but because of a modest influx of price-insensitive money. Prices get set on the margin. On Wall Street, it doesn\u2019t take an influx of $5 Trillion into the stock market to move the total market capitalization of all of the companies from $15 Trillion to $20 Trillion. (In fact, money never moves into the stock market \u2013 it moves *through* the stock market, but that\u2019s another post). Rather, a small series of secondary transactions at the margin, done by price-insensitive buyers at high prices, can move the quotational value of each stock considerably higher. Similarly, a small number of high-profile Angel investments, moving small amounts of capital but at very high valuations, can make the entire market look overvalued.\nSo what\u2019s driving the new, price-insensitive bidders? It\u2019s three things:\n1) VC Funds \u2013 Every VC that announces a $20M seed fund is basically a price-insensitive Super-Angel. They\u2019re buying first looks and options to finance companies in the future, so they\u2019re not particularly price sensitive. When you have $1B under management, $20M is pocket change.\n2) Entrepreneurs Set Pricing \u2013 Leaderless \u201cparty\u201d rounds often end up with the entrepreneurs setting the valuation. And clever entrepreneurs are getting the less price sensitive investors to sign off on the initial terms, and then taking those terms, social proof in hand, to Investors who would have been traditionally more price sensitive.\n3) New Angels \u2013 People who have had modest exits and are now angels are just building their portfolios. They don\u2019t have enough exits under their belts to understand that price does matter. Not as much as in other businesses, because a Power Law distribution here means that one winner can dominate your whole portfolio. But it still matters because a lower price allows you to pick more startups in the hope of finding that one winner. New angels often hear that \u201cIf it\u2019s the right company, price is irrelevant.\u201d That\u2019s true, but that gives too much credence in your own ability to pick the right company. If you\u2019re informed just enough to know how un-informed you are, then you doubt your ability to consistently pick winners, and a low price will give you more attempts to figure it out.\nSo does this always end in tears?\nFor VCs, they will look back at these seed funds and find that (a) their seed efforts didn\u2019t have the best returns and that (b) they didn\u2019t always get the first look options that they always wanted. But it will probably still pay off. Seed is the new Series A, and if you don\u2019t do Seed, you\u2019re basically retreating to later stage.\nFor Angels who are price-disciplined, things will be fine \u2013 we are undergoing an incredible renaissance in technology, with smart phones taking computing to local arenas and social networks taking it into the mainstream populace. There\u2019s a lot of opportunity and great companies will be built. For un-discplined Angels, there will be pain (unless they find their one big winner early), but it\u2019s part of the learning curve inherent in the business.\nEntrepreneurs win big, all-around. There has been some concern that all of these small companies are going to get orphaned \u2013 who will fund them downstream? I don\u2019t necessarily view this as a negative, though. Even failed, these entrepreneurs are going to be much more employable than those who never tried or had the opportunity, and given that the minimum efficient scale of businesses is getting smaller and smaller, more of them will succeed than in any previous generation.\nEntrepreneurs sticking to the old model of hiring are getting hurt. The old model used to be that after a Series A, you could hire an engineer and give him 0.25% of the company. Good luck hiring a great engineer for that in Silicon Valley now, for a freshly-minted startup with a small seed round in your pocket. The opportunity cost for that engineer is now to go join a Seed Combinator or raise some Angel funding. So, we\u2019re going to see the equity gap narrow between the founders of raw startups and early key team members. Only the best startups with high valuations and tremendous traction can recruit under the old formulas anymore.", "sentiment": -0.475, "pageUrl": "https://nav.al/there-is-no-angel-bubble-there-are-many-angel-bubbles", "date": "Tue, 30 Nov 2010 23:00:00 GMT", "person": "naval_ravikant"}, {"title": "The Unbundling of the Venture Capital Industry", "text": "People often mock Super-Angels as being impure because they invest other people\u2019s money. We also often get asked \u201cWhat are VCs and Seed Funds doing on AngelList?\u201d (They\u2019re clearly marked, by the way, and you can choose who your pitch is visible to.)\nI will propose, however, that whose money you\u2019re investing is less relevant than on what terms it comes on. Venture Hacks was created to educate entrepreneurs when the Angel market was much less robust. At the time, if you wanted anything more than $250K, you basically had to go to Venture Capital.\nVenture Capital, at the time, was a bundle of three things \u2013 Advice, Control, and Money.\nThe money is obvious \u2013 you want money, you go get it. But in the case of VC, it came with control \u2013 because the amounts being disbursed were large enough, it made sense that they needed to be actively managed. And finally, because it was actively managed, you cared about how well it was managed, and thus the advice.\nNow, thanks to increased dissemination of information on the web, Venture Hacks and many others (Series Seed, A VC, Feld Thoughts, The Funded, etc.) have helped entrepreneurs understand the control layer. Y Combinator and other seed incubators have essentially helped \u201cunion-ize\u201d the startup workforce, and via reputation and standardized documents, reduce the control that VCs have over startups. Lower capital requirements have opened up the playing field of investors, and reduced the need or even the ability of early-stage investors to do active portfolio management.\nSo Angels are investors who leave out the control. They essentially bundle just Advice and Money.\nThe amount of money invested and whose money it is are factors that play into it, but most Super-Angels eschew control. Similarly, some seed funds (i.e., True Ventures), and some larger funds (i.e., Andreessen-Horowitz) make entrepreneur-friendliness a core part of their ethos, and as such often leave out classic control provisions (M&A vetos) or mechanisms (Board seats). Conversely, you\u2019ll see some Super-Angels or even traditional angels asking for more control if they\u2019re investing a significant portion of their investable capital.\nWe are also seeing the emergence of Seed Combinators and Pure Money plays. Y Combinator, TechStars, I/O Ventures, AngelPad, Founder Institute, etc., are basically giving advice \u2013 if you\u2019re going there for the funding, then you\u2019re not doing the math. DST and later stage funds are pure sources of money.\nThe net effect is that the Venture Capital is slowly being un-bundled, as mature industries often are.\nOne side effect of all of this is that reputation matters a lot less. It used to be that VC reputation was built on their ability to pick winners (this has signaling value to other investors and potential employees), the advice that they gave, and how friendly they were to the entrepreneurs, given that they essentially had Board control. Most of this doesn\u2019t matter anymore \u2013 it\u2019s only the signaling and advice that carries much value for savvy entrepreneurs, and even the advice part is gradually being augmented and possibly replaced.\nThere is one thing that the new unbundled model can\u2019t replace \u2013 which is the subtle influence of incentives. You may be able to get advice from the best advisors, money from the cheapest source, and keep control for yourself, but the one thing that an experienced VC partner can *uniquely* provide you is someone who has a strong incentive (because they own a lot of your company), and a very different perspective and experience base.

However, that\u2019s not the whole story.\nIn public markets, Investors make their decisions to invest in parallel, and in theory, most of the relevant information about a company is publicly disclosed, by law. Businesses are also much more mature, and therefore easier to value. Finally, the market is very liquid and very deep, so there isn\u2019t much uncertainty about the supply of money available and availability of money in the future.\nIn a public market, it\u2019s unlikely that I have access to private data about a company\u2019s prospects, and if I do, I buy or sell the stock and move the price.

Businesses are brand new and immature, and very difficult to value. The market is shallow and illiquid, and a \u201cKeynesian Beauty Contest\u201d means that you want to finance a company now just because it is likely to be financed in the future.\nTherefore, when you see other investors piling into a company, you can infer: \u2013 They probably know something about the company or the market that you don\u2019t, given that a lot of the information (quality of founders, state of competition, true size of market, etc.) is private and scattered across many minds\n\u2013 This company is more likely to get financed in the future, since it seems able to attract many, high quality investors (the aforementioned Keynesian Beauty Contest)\n\u2013 And you *still have time to act at the same price* on this new information\nThat last fact more than any other causes Investors to move in herds.\nIt is rational for private investors to move in herds.

One told the story of a 27-year-old whiz kid whose company will likely exit for $500M \u2013 $1B \u2013 the business now being less than two years old. You can imagine the effect that this had on the brilliant, hardworking 35+ entrepreneurs in the group, who have had their share of hits, but not at that magnitude and not that quickly.\nThese stories are getting more commonplace. It seems that the entrepreneurs who \u201chit\u201d these days are doing it more quickly, making more money, and doing it at a younger age. Back in the 70s, it took a decade plus to build a company and $10M, even in today\u2019s dollars, was a big victory for an individual. Up until the late 90s dot-com boom, even though these stories existed, they were less common and took longer.\nThe storyteller explained that this 27-year-old is more brilliant and more hard-working than the previous entrepreneurs he\u2019s seen.\nThat can\u2019t be it. There are only so many hours in the day, and the entrepreneurs of yesteryear worked just as hard as the entrepreneurs of today. And the ones who came before were just as brilliant. Human intelligence has not evolved that dramatically in 10-20 years.\nRather, I posit that the amount of leverage available to a modern Internet entrepreneur is far, far greater than was available to entrepreneurs of previous generations. The number of entrants has dramatically increased as well. The overall hit rate might be lower, but the ones who win, win bigger and faster thanks to the leverage.\nGone are server farms, telesales and support, marcom material, tradeshow booths, direct sales forces, licensed software, mountains of code, reseller agreements, plane tickets, hotel rooms, printing CDs, voicemail systems, and so on and so forth.\nModern Internet entrepreneurship starts with a few engineers working for nothing and carrying latops and cellphones. They coordinate with Skype and GTalk and wikis and bug tracking sytems. The company itself is snapped together with outsourced HR, cookie-cutter incorporation, and outsourced finance / payroll. Marketing is done virally, or through SEO, or SEM. Customer service is handled via the community and forums. PR and outreach through tweets and blogging. Payments come via Paypal. Ads are served up by third-party ad networks. Storage goes on Amazon. Computation scales via Amazon, Softlayer or Rackspace. Code is built upon stacks of open source, SaaS, and $10/month services.\nWhat used to cost $1M-$2M to set up, now costs $10K. What used to cost $5M to build, now costs $250K. What used to cost $20M to go to market now costs $1M.\nBut the upside hasn\u2019t gone down. It has gone *up.* The 3 billionth person will be online shortly. They can all use the product. Network effects are stronger than ever, and some businesses become natural monopolies very quickly. Most web products have no marginal cost of replication, so adding a new customer is pure profit.\nLess labor required. Less capital required. Less cost to scale. Larger markets. Cheaper marketing. No cost to ship more product.\nNo, people aren\u2019t getting any smarter or harder-working. But the amount of leverage is obscene. The hits \u2013 Yahoo!, EBay, Google, Skype, MySpace, YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, Zynga, are each arriving faster than the previous one did. And the leverage is increasing, not decreasing.\nThe returns to scale for being smart, young, skilled, and high-energy have gone up tremendously, and that has profound implications for society. The smart are getting richer.\nUpdate: An insightful comment on Hacker News: Basically, the Internet is a wide and deep place. The depth creates a few huge winners and the breadth creates a large number of small winners (who would have been losers in the old system, but due to the above-mentioned low costs, can still win). What\u2019s missing is the traditionally fat middle. We\u2019ve gone from a normally distributed set of outcomes, to a power-law distribution. The median is a small fraction of the mean. This is bad news for anyone who has built their business predicated on their achieving mean outcomes. That includes mid-stage VC funds, moderately-capitalized companies (traditionally speaking), and societies that care about \u201cequal\u201d outcomes.", "sentiment": 0, "pageUrl": "https://nav.al/the-returns-to-entrepreneurship", "date": "Sun, 08 Nov 2009 23:00:00 GMT", "person": "naval_ravikant"}, {"title": "Extrapolating Computing", "text": "Remember when mainframes did all of the computing?

In part I, he\u2019s digging through the data. Some of his observations are powerful and worth summarizing:\n\"Generally, productivity \u2014 output \u2014 rises rapidly from the start of a career to a peak and then declines gradually until retirement.\nThis peak in productivity varies by field, from the late 20s to the early 50s, for reasons that are field-specific.\nPrecocity, longevity, and output rate are linked. \"Those who are precocious also tend to display longevity, and both precocity and longevity are positively associated with high output rates per age unit.\" High producers produce highly, systematically, over time.\nThe odds of a hit versus a miss do not increase over time. The periods of one\u2019s career with the most hits will also have the most misses. So maximizing quantity \u2014 taking more swings at the bat \u2014 is much higher payoff than trying to improve one\u2019s batting average.\nIntelligence, at least as measured by metrics such as IQ, is largely irrelevant.\"\nI went through an evolution of sorts on this topic.\nI started with a variation of the Beard Hypothesis (enthusiasm decreases with age but experience increases, and there\u2019s an optimum cross-over point). This is the easiest viewpoint as you get older and look back at some of your earlier crazier ideas, but notice that that older crowd is very risk-averse. Douglas Adams had a great take on it:\n\"everything that\u2019s already in the world when you\u2019re born is just normal;\nanything that gets invented between then and before you turn thirty is incredibly exciting and creative and with any luck you can make a career out of it;\nanything that gets invented after you\u2019re thirty is against the natural order of things and the beginning of the end of civilisation as we know it until it\u2019s been around for about ten years when it gradually turns out to be alright really.\nApply this list to movies, rock music, word processors and mobile phones to work out how old you are.\"\nI then moved on to Dean Simonton\u2019s observations, beautifully covered in Marc\u2019s article. My thinking was driven by books like \"The Black Swan,\" \"Fooled by Randomness,\" DeVany\u2019s analysis of Hollywood Economics and Home-Run Hitting, and a casual observation of how Evolution creates things (massive trial and error). Basically, the number of swings at bat, poems attempted, paintings painted, etc. determine the success rate. The more you try, the more you learn, the faster you iterate, the better you get, and the more chances that you have of being productive. Your outcome scales more with the number of bets than the size of the bets. As the violinist Pablo De Sarasate put it, \"For 37 years I\u2019ve practiced 14 hours a day, and now they call me a genius. \"\nNow I prefer a slightly different hypothesis. More of the creative instinct is driven by the sublimated sex drive and the desire to attract a mate than we give it credit for. And more of it is squelched by the demands of family than anything else. An extreme take on it is presented by Kanazawa:\n\"Scientists tend to \u2018desist\u2019 from scientific research upon marriage, just like criminals desist from crime upon marriage.\"\nMarc asks:\n\"So here\u2019s my first challenge: to anyone who has an opinion on the role of age and entrepreneurship \u2014 see if you can fit your opinion into this model!\"\nWhen you are young, hungry, and single, you have\nhuge amounts of free time (more swings at the ball)\nless to lose (more swings)\nenthusiasm (more likely to swing)\nsublimated sex drive (more likely to swing to stand out from your peers).\nAs you age, you have\nless free time, more family demands, larger social networks (less swings)\nmore to lose (public embarrassment in front of an established social circle means you don\u2019t want to start anything fresh) (less swings)\nexperience (if you\u2019re probably going to miss, why bother swinging) (less swings)\nfulfilled sex drive (have sex rather than swing)\n\"And here\u2019s my second challenge: is entrepreneurship more like poetry, pure mathematics, and theoretical physics \u2014 which exhibit a peak age in one\u2019s late 20s or early 30s \u2014 or novel writing, history, philosophy, medicine, and general scholarship \u2014 which exhibit a peak age in one\u2019s late 40s or early 50s? And how, and why?\"\nUnfortunately for an aging me, anecdotal evidence aside, entrepreneurship favors the young.\nThe difference between poetry, pure math, theoretical physics, and novel writing, history, philosophy, medicine, scholarship, is that the former set requires huge (multi-year) intense, focused, almost isolated blocks of free time, whereas the latter set can be picked up and put down and resumed later without too much cost. The first set comprises problems that are solved by an emotional state (poetry, painting), by loading a very difficult single framework into your head (math, physics, coding), and / or competition (driven by sex drive and time-sensitive). The latter set are more rational, are systems problems rather than point problems, and don\u2019t have time-sensitive competition.\nModern entrepreneurship, especially web entrepreneurship, is extremely competitive / time sensitive, requires enormous amounts of iteration even within a single product life-cycle, and often requires solving many challenging technical and business problems one after the other in a public view (with the opposite sex watching). So, it favors the young and single.\nWhich is not to say that one can\u2019t do it if one is older and settled down. Mathematician Paul Erdos was famous for his prioritizing his work above all else (he remained single, by the way). There are many older successful entrepreneurs who spend tremendous amounts of time away from their families.\n\u2026and the rest give up and just become VCs\u2026", "sentiment": 0.642, "pageUrl": "https://nav.al/the-aging-entrepreneur", "date": "Tue, 07 Aug 2007 23:00:00 GMT", "person": "naval_ravikant"}, {"title": "STIRR discovers Price Discrimination", "text": "At STIRR events, VCs fly business class, but entrepreneurs fly coach I have a similar rule \u2013 whenever I go to coffee / lunch / dinner for business, the person who has raised more money pays\u2026", "sentiment": -0.397, "pageUrl": "https://nav.al/at-stirr-events-vcs-fly-business-class-but-entrepreneurs-fly-coach-i-have-a-similar-rule-whenever-i-go-to-coffee-lunch-dinner-for-business-the-person-who-has-raised-more-money-pays8230", "date": "Sat, 14 Jul 2007 23:00:00 GMT", "person": "naval_ravikant"}, {"title": "Venture Hacks is Hiring \u2013 One Man Developer Army", "text": "Big things coming on Venture Hacks but we need a great developer to help us out.

Now it\u2019s time to consider exactly how effective it is.\nIf the Genie of the Market were to offer you all of the future earnings from EBay or Craigslist, which would you take? I\u2019d take Craigslist.\nNote that I\u2019m talking about the strengths of the business models here. I\u2019m fully aware that EBay owns 25% of Craigslist, so to say that Craigslist the company is worth more than EBay the company, I\u2019d be saying that the capitalized Craigslist business model earnings are equal to twice the capitalized EBay business model earnings, and that is not what I\u2019m saying. For evaluating the above numbers, look at the earnings generated by the business models, or assume that EBay owns 0% of Craigslist.\nEstimating Valuation by listings\nCraigslist currently carries 6M ads per month. At least 200,000 of these listings are job postings. They are in close to 200 cities (looking at their home page). They probably only have critical mass in about ten of those cities or less (from some casual browsing).\nCurrently, Craigslist charges only for Job postings, and only in three cities. Taken from Craigslist itself, we can see the rates:\nAnd now they are adding fees for apartments in NY, and jobs in Washington DC, San Diego, Boston, and Seattle. Basically, as soon as a category in a city hits unassailable critical mass, look out!\nSo, jobs alone is today worth about $5 Million per month ($25 * 200K). Craigslist isn\u2019t monetizing it all, but the direction and the intent are both clear.\nOf course, Craigslist will eventually be able to charge for jobs, apartments, real estate, cars, a little bit for personals, vacation rentals, services, big local items, and in some countries, small EBay items. Notice that online, each of those 7-8 other categories is on the same order of magnitude as jobs, or bigger. The EBay items part may need some clarification \u2013 in countries where the development of the Internet precedes the development of a reliable postal system, more product commerce will happen over a Craigslist-style local system than over an EBay-style national system.\nIf Craigslist only monetizes half of these, that\u2019s $20M per month. All of them and it\u2019s $40M per month.\nBut Craigslist is still growing. A LOT.\nHere are some stats that Craigslist itself has been handing out (these are about three months old):\nGrowth\nOverall Page View Growth Rate (all cities combined) for last 12 months: 195%\nRaleigh, NC: 13M pages/month +800% last 12 mos\nVancouver, BC: 21M pages/month +675% last 12 mos\nDallas, TX: 22M pages/month +650% last 12 mos\nMinneapolis: 21M pages/month +625% last 12 mos\nCan they double in size within a year? Easily. More likely, Craigslist will triple or quadruple in size before growth starts slowing significantly. Our previous range of $20-$40M / month now goes to $40 \u2013 $160M / month (as we make more guesses, our accuracy goes down, of course). The midpoint has us at $100M in revenue per month, or about $1.2B per year!\nTry it another way: Take 6M listings a month. Multiply by 10 as they hit critical mass in 100 cities, as opposed to approximately 10 cities today. Multiply by 2 since existing cities like NY, LA, SF will continue to grow. Charge for a mere 10% of the listings, and charge $10 per listing (that\u2019s a steal compared to the newspapers, and lower than Craigslist\u2019s current rates. It\u2019s also an average charge of $1 per listing). That\u2019s $1.4 Billion in revenue per year. Their cost is near-zero (no content, no marketing, community-based customer service, a dozen engineers). After taxes, that\u2019s still $1B in profit per year. Give them EBay\u2019s P/E and it\u2019s worth $50+ Billion.\nI\u2019m not adjusting the P/E for the fact that they are growing much, much faster than EBay (although that will inevitably slow down), or that their international opportunity is larger than EBay\u2019s (that pesky postal system thing again).\nTraffic Check:\nHere\u2019s another fun way to look at it. Alexa and other ranking sites mis-classify Craigslist as a community site. It has a traffic rank of 33 on Alexa (up from #40 when I wrote my first draft of this article last November!!), but if you were to consider it as a commerce site (it\u2019s classifieds, after all), it would be the 4th largest one, right behind Amazon, Ebay, and Yahoo.\nCraigslist\u2019s growth has actually picked UP. How many big, successful companies are doing that?\n2005 has been a great year for Craigslist.\nOf course, for the other classifieds sites, it\u2019s a massacre:\nSo, will Craig take the money? Well, 25% of the company already belongs to EBay (they bought it from a co-founder of Craig\u2019s). Of the remainder, undoubtedly some is in the hands of employees. Craig is probably somewhere between 50% and 60%. He may want to give some of it to charity. Or family. Inevitably, he will own less than 50%. At that point, you can bet that the company will embrace capitalism and the virtues of liquidity.\nCraigslist is a dot-org no more. It\u2019s a supercharged monopoly in the making for the single most monetizable category in the world (high-ticket items and classifieds), tripling or better year-over-year. And Craig Newmark, Customer Service Representative, is worth more than Larry Page or Sergei Brin.\nThe real story is that Craig is well on his way to building an EBay / Yahoo! sized business with no venture capital, no big-shot management, no marketing, no patents, no real technology, etc. He\u2019s taken all the value from newspapers with none of the cost. And everyone loves him for it (probably because he\u2019s leaving the money on the table). That\u2019s the power of the Internet.", "sentiment": 0, "pageUrl": "https://nav.al/craigslist-is-worth-more-than-ebay", "date": "Mon, 06 Feb 2006 23:00:00 GMT", "person": "naval_ravikant"}, {"title": "Dare Microsoft Kill Google?

This argument is flawed on many economic levels, but let\u2019s overlook that for a moment. Let\u2019s give everyone a stake.\nSuppose that we gave every US citizen an extra passport \u2013 a blank one. Within certain common-sense restrictions (i.e., no terrorists) each person could sell their extra passport to a would-be immigrant. You could give it to someone deserving, or patriotic, or brilliant, or whoever would just pay you a lot of cash. You could perhaps exchange it for a foreign one. Likely, markets would emerge to value and trade these things, and people would pay or promise future earnings streams (personal IPOs in the best case, indentured servitude in the worst) to get into desirable countries.\nBut now think what would happen if a country enacted bad trade or tax policy. The sum of all of the value of the passports would equal the capitalized value of the government of the country. Poor policy that reduced this value would result in the demand, and therefore the price, of passports falling. Your passport and your extra one would probably be your most valuable possessions, worth millions of dollars. Poor government policy would lead to massive negative feedback from the citizen-shareholders.\nIn fact, certain un-monetizable policies would now reveal their costs, and we could see the value of pro-choice v. pro-life, certain environmental policies, etc. If your government isn\u2019t doing things the way that you want, you can always sell your passport and get out, but likely the poor government would be ousted by citizen-shareholders first.\nFinally, in the fanciful stretch case, countries that have shown themselves to be astute economic managers could engage in hostile yet peaceful takeovers of the publicly-traded passports of poorly managed countries.

The list includes peer-to-peer lending, social networks for recommending things, new group communication systems, downloadable photo sharing clients, etc. While some similar schemes have worked in the past (notably, MySpace, Flickr, EBay, Skype, Craigslist), the set that have failed are much much larger.\nThe problem with starting one of these businesses as an entrepreneur is that you basically have to get up the adoption curve before any rational VC will think about investing in you. Sure, if it works out, these businesses can have phenomenal network effects, but in advance of user adoption, it is nearly impossible to quantify the adoption risk in any way, and so it becomes a very very hard sell to VCs.
